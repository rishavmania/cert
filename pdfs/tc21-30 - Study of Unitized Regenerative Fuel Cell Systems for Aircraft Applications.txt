Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) have been explored as potential high energy density power systems for aerial and space 
applications due to their potential to provide multiple functions with a single set of stack hardware. System designers and 
researchers have developed demonstration-scale URFCs using low temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) and solid 
oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies. Both technologies have shown promise but exhibit features that are disadvantages for 
integration into an aircraft. High temperature proton exchange membrane (HTPEM) technology could have the ability to achieve 
the advantages of the previous technologies explored without the downsides. A 125-kW HTPEM URFC system design was 
developed specifically for an electric propulsion application. The system consists of a URFC stack stored within the oxygen 
reactant storage tank to save volume, simplify water management, and reduce system complexity. A hydrogen storage tank, 
thermal control system, pressure/flow control devices, and the control logic required to maintain safe and effective system 
operation were included and system concepts, operational parameters, and alarm conditions were defined. A system model was 
developed to explore the performance of the system in fuel cell mode during flight and electrolysis mode to recharge the reactant 
storage tanks while on the ground. The system was shown to be effective in providing power for one, two, and five-hour flights 
with a recharge time approximately equal to the time of the flight. Despite the projected success of the simulation, the mass and 
volume of components required to implement the HTPEM URFC into an aircraft may be prohibitive without extensive 
development and improvements in the system design and performance of individual components, including the URFC stack.

Executive summary 

This document provides a summary of activities performed by Teledyne for the FAA under 

contract 692M15-19-C-00005. The scope of this contract was to explore the potential of a 

unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC) system to provide power onboard an aircraft. Fuel cell 

systems are being explored as potentially useful power systems for aerial applications as the 

industry transitions to more electric aircraft designs that can better utilize their advantages. A 

URFC system can provide operational advantages for an aircraft, such as long mission durations 

or persistent flight, reduced requirements for fuel infrastructure, and reduced system mass and 

volume. 

URFC systems have been explored as potential power sources for multiple applications 

involving mass and volume minimization, including space and aerial vehicles. Much research 
and development has been performed on developing the technology from the cell level, which 

requires careful choice of materials that can survive the electrochemical environment in both fuel 

cell and electrolysis modes, and flexible cell designs that handle reactants and products of each 

reaction without impeding the process. Developers have attempted to build their designs around 

either low temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) or solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) 

technologies, each built upon several decades of maturation in fuel cell applications. 

Demonstration hardware at the single cell, short stack, and full stack levels has been 

manufactured and tested for performance. Both technologies have shown the ability to operate in 

a reversible mode, but with several technical challenges that make long-term, stable, and durable 

operation difficult in practice. LTPEM technology struggles with managing the two-phase flow 

of water, especially during transitions between modes. SOFC technology requires large heat 

inputs and does not easily handle transitions between power levels or start-stop cycles. High 

temperature proton exchange membrane (HTPEM) technology has the potential of eliminating 

the downsides of both previously explored URFC technologies, but has yet to be explored in this 

application due to the lower level maturity of the technology. 

Teledyne has developed a conceptual design of a 125-kW HTPEM URFC system to be 

integrated into an aircraft. Potential applications include direct power for electric propulsion in 

small aircraft or a load-balancing device for larger aircraft, such as a 787 Dreamliner. The 

electric propulsion application was explored in detail during this study. The system consists of an 

open-cathode URFC stack with HTPEM technology stored within the oxygen reactant storage 

tank. This provides advantages by simplifying water management, eliminating oxygen flow 

control devices, and minimizing volume. This arrangement raises multiple safety issues that must 

be addressed in the detailed design, including the potential for hydrogen-oxygen gas mixtures 

ix 

 
 
 
 
due to leakage, product water sloshing, and electrical shorting of the stack. A hydrogen storage 

tank, thermal control system, pressure/flow control devices, and control logic were defined and 

described in detail to maintain safe and effective system operation over the length of the 

proposed flight. The concept of operations, system parameters, and alarm conditions were 

defined to provide a framework for system operation. Individual components were selected with 

performance data and physical specifications gathered. 

A system model was developed based upon the URFC system design. The model used power 

consumption data from all of the components required for operation, performance data from 

HTPEM technology during power production and electrolysis, thermal requirements defined by 

the stack mass and efficiency, and expected flight profile of one, two, and five-hour flights. 

Performance was evaluated in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes of operation. The system was 

shown to be effective in providing power for the electric propulsion application with enough 

reactant supply to handle the worst-case scenario. Refueling times were shown to be less than or 

equal to the mission duration. The major disadvantage of this system is the power and energy 

density of less than 100 W/kg and 200 Wh/kg, which is not competitive with lithium ion battery 

technology of similar scale, largely due to the size and mass of the reactant storage tanks. 

Recommendations include scaling the system down to the kW or sub-kW scale to reduce the 

reactant tank mass, exploring Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) studies to explore the 

safety implications and identify areas of improvement, and putting resources into improving the 

HTPEM technology itself to maximize efficiency and durability.

Introduction 

This document contains the details of the study completed by Teledyne for the FAA in exploring 

URFC systems for aircraft integration. The program started with a survey of URFC technology 

described in Section 2, including the research and development history, hardware development, 

and recommendations for future direction. Using those recommendations, a system design was 

developed, as described in Section 3, that details the URFC stack, reactant storage tanks, thermal 

control system, pressure and flow controls, control logic, concept of operations, operational 

parameters, alarm conditions, and safety implications. A simulation of an electric propulsion 

aircraft using this URFC as its power system was developed and it is described in Section 4, 

followed by overall conclusions of the study in Section 5. 

2  Unitized regenerative fuel cell technology report 

This section provides a summary of the literature review, technology selection, and definition of 

aircraft application performed by Teledyne on unitized regenerative fuel cell systems. Teledyne 

participated in discussions with aircraft industry representatives and the FAA regarding possible 

applications for a URFC on an aircraft. These discussions culminated in a proposed URFC 

application for analysis under this program. Teledyne gathered and reviewed published research 

and commercially available information on URFC technology. The material was summarized 

and reviewed by a team of fuel cell subject experts. The team made recommendations for the 

best available technology to satisfy the performance requirements of a potential URFC aircraft 

application. 

A definition of a regenerative fuel cell is provided along with the differences between discrete 

and unitized regenerative fuel cell systems. Previous research and development of URFC 

technologies is reviewed and discussed. LTPEM technology has an extensive history of 

development by NASA, universities, and private organizations because of a high technical 

maturity level through parallel developments in the fuel cell industry. Reversible Solid Oxide 

Fuel Cell (RSOFC) have been researched with interest in recent years due to its ease of 

reversibility found experimentally. HTPEM, although the least mature of the available 

technologies discussed in this report, can also be used for regenerative fuel cell (RFC) 

applications. The technology selection made by the Teledyne review team is derived from the 

information summarized above.

2.1  Regenerative fuel cell definition 

Regenerative fuel cell (RFC) systems have been studied as a potential power system concept that 

can provide many operational benefits to the user. RFCs are fuel cell power systems that are 

reversible, meaning that they can be operated both in fuel cell mode to produce power with 

reactant inputs and in electrolysis mode to produce reactants with power input. When designed 

as a closed loop system, the reactants produced during electrolysis are kept in storage to be used 

later in fuel cell mode for power production. Conserving reactants through closed loop system 

design in RFCs enables long duration power system operation in a smaller package by 

eliminating the need to refuel. 

In theory, RFCs can be composed of any combination of fuel cell and electrolysis technologies, 

provided that the same reversible reaction is used for the fuel cell and electrolysis modes of 
operation. There are two types of RFC systems: discrete and unitized. The differences between 

the two types of RFCs are described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 below. 

2.1.1  Discrete regenerative fuel cells 

Discrete RFCs are reversible fuel cell systems that employ separate hardware units to perform 

the power-producing and reactant-evolution processes. A system diagram of a discrete RFC 

utilizing the hydrogen-oxygen reaction is shown in Figure 1. The system can start in any state if 

a source of power is available. 

Figure 1: Discrete regenerative fuel cell system diagram 

2 

 
 
 
 
The following is how a discrete RFC functions assuming a proton exchange membrane (PEM)-

based system that is fully supplied with hydrogen and oxygen reactants at the beginning of 

operation. When power is required, hydrogen and oxygen reactants are withdrawn from the 

storage tanks and routed to the fuel cell stack. The fuel cell stack reacts the hydrogen and oxygen 

to produce DC power that can be used by an available electronic load. The hydrogen-oxygen 

reaction produces water, which is removed from the fuel cell stack and stored in a separate 

vessel. The fuel cell continues to produce power until either the demand from the electronic 

device is removed or the reactant storage tanks are emptied. When power is available for the 

system to use, the water produced during fuel cell mode is withdrawn from the storage tanks and 

routed to the electrolyzer module. The electrolyzer uses the available DC power to 

electrochemically split the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The gasses are pumped back 

into the storage tanks to be used again by the fuel cell stack later. 

A discrete RFC system is simple in that the fuel cell stack and electrolysis module hardware used 

can be similar to, if not the same as, those used in standalone power generation or gas production 

applications. The hardware configuration can be optimized for each reaction with the use of 

separate devices. Discrete RFCs can quickly transition between the two modes of operation with 

very few restrictions and could even run in both modes simultaneously if the application required 

the system to do so. Although simple in concept, discrete RFC designs can increase the mass and 

volume of the power system beyond what is normally acceptable for mobile power applications.  

2.1.2  Unitized regenerative fuel cells 

Unitized RFCs are reversible fuel cell systems that can generate power or reactants using a single 

electrochemical unit. A system diagram of a unitized RFC utilizing the hydrogen-oxygen 

reaction is shown in Figure 2. The operation of a unitized RFC is similar to a discrete RFC. 

When power is required, hydrogen and oxygen are withdrawn from the reactant storage tanks 
and routed to the unitized stack. The unitized stack reacts the hydrogen and oxygen to produce 

DC power that can be used by an available electronic load. The water produced from the reaction 

is removed from the stack and stored in a separate vessel. Power is produced until either the 

demand from the electronic device is removed or the reactant storage tanks are emptied. The 

water produced during fuel cell mode is withdrawn from the storage tanks and routed back to the 

same stack when power is available. The water is electrochemically split into hydrogen and 

oxygen gas, which are pumped back into the storage tanks for later use. 

3 

 
 
 
Figure 2. Unitized regenerative fuel cell system diagram 

Unitized RFC systems have promise as power systems for aircraft, especially those employing 
electric power for some or all the propulsion and device power requirements. These aircraft 

require an increased specific energy to meet target aircraft weight requirements. A unitized RFC 

requires less mass and volume than a discrete RFC due to the use of a single electrochemical 

stack that performs both reactions. Proper integration of a unitized RFC into an aircraft can 

enable successful operation of new aircraft designs. 

Unitized RFCs come with performance limitations. They can be more difficult to manage and 

operate than discrete RFCs. The hardware design must be capable of performing each 

electrochemical reaction at an efficient rate without compromising operation in the reverse mode 

or sacrificing stack durability. Transitions from one mode to the other are challenging because 

the products of the previous reaction must be cleared and the optimal operational conditions for 

each mode are different. Simultaneous operation in both modes is not an option with unitized 

systems. 

2.2  Unitized regenerative fuel cell technology 

The potential benefits of unitized RFCs in mobile applications have driven various organizations 

to invest in research and development of URFCs. The main challenge is to find technologies that 

can perform well as both fuel cells and electrolyzers. Research has focused on incorporating 

materials into the stack design that perform both functions efficiently while remaining stable and 

durable over an extended period of use. Other system design challenges have been investigated 

as well, such as handling transitions between operating modes and optimizing thermal 

management. This work has led to hardware demonstrations to test the concepts, mostly 

consisting of single cell or small, subscale stack tests. 

4 

 
 
 
A literature survey of unitized RFC technology was conducted to provide an understanding of 

the current capabilities of unitized systems and potential hardware available. The survey focused 

on two electrochemical technologies: Proton Exchange Membrane RFCs and Solid Oxide RFCs. 

These two technologies represent the most mature electrochemical processes used for mobile 

power for terrestrial, aerial, and space applications by both commercial and government users. 

The survey focused on research efforts that included demonstration hardware to help increase the 

applicability and practicality of the conclusions drawn. 

2.2.1  Low temperature PEM RFCs 

The most mature electrochemical technology for mobile applications is the PEM fuel cell. PEM 

fuel cell technology was originally developed in the 1960s and used by NASA on the Gemini 

missions and other subsequent space programs. Most PEM cells use Nafion, a fluoropolymer 
material that conducts protons when hydrated, to allow the transport of protons derived from the 

hydrogen used in the reaction. The insulating properties of Nafion divert the electric current 

produced by the reaction through an external circuit, thus generating power for electrical devices. 

Recent development of PEM fuel cell technology in the industry has focused on cost reduction 

and increased reliability to optimize the technology for commercial automotive, material 

handling, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. An extensive development history of 

the technology for over 50 years along with established component materials, designs, and 

supply chains make PEM technology a logical choice for a unitized RFC system. 

2.2.1.1 Applications and demonstrations 
The history of LTPEM URFCs goes back almost as far as PEM technology itself. In the early 

1970s, General Electric explored the concept of a LTPEM URFC for providing power onboard a 

geosynchronous satellite with a seven to ten year lifetime (Mitlitsky F. , Lightweight Pressure 

Vessels and Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cells, 1996) (Mitlitsky F. , Unitized Regenerative Fuel 
Cell Systems, 1998). Using alternate but similar materials to today’s PEM technology, GE 

performed single cell testing for over 700 cycles to show that the concept could work with 
minimal performance degradation (< 40 mV at 108 mA/cm2). Despite the successful 
demonstration, the technology was never advanced to the point of integration into the intended 

application. 

NASA has devoted much funding and attention to developing a LTPEM unitized RFC system 

that could be used in a space or aerial application. NASA began to research LTPEM technology 

for use in an RFC system to power High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft, 

extraterrestrial outposts, and terrestrial secondary battery applications in the 1990s. Initial system 

concepts and design studies showed that an RFC based on PEM technology could provide mass 

5 

 
 
reduction over batteries in applications when discharge times were greater than one hour (Burke, 

Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell Development, 2003). One such concept showed that indefinite 

operation is possible in an ultralight aircraft design on a 12-hour charge, 12-hour discharge cycle 

(Burke, High Energy Density Regenerative Fuel Cell Systems for Terrestrial Applications, 

1999). The system concept uses solar panels mounted to the wings to power the engines and 

perform water electrolysis during the day. The hydrogen and oxygen generated from electrolysis 

would provide 3.5 kW of power through twelve hours of fuel cell operation when no solar power 

is available. NASA’s study showed that energy density approaching 800 Wh/kg was achievable 

through implementation of passive system design components and clever integration of the RFC 

system hardware into the aircraft structure. Passive system design concepts included wrapping 

the gas tubing around the tank to serve as a gas dryer/humidifier, a pressure-loaded bellows for 

water storage, and implementation of heat pipes that reject heat from the unitized stack to the 
reactant storage tanks (USA Patent No. 7,410,714 B1, 2004) (Burke, Unitized Regenerative Fuel 

Cell System Gas Storage-Radiatior Development, 2005). 

Physicists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) began investigating unitized 

LTPEM RFC systems for potential use in HALE aircraft in the mid-1990s with NASA and 

Department of Energy (DOE) support. The lightweight power system requirement for the 

application drove LLNL to develop URFCs and novel pressure vessels that could be integrated 

into the aircraft (Mitlitsky F. , Lightweight Pressure Vessels and Unitized Regenerative Fuel 
Cells, 1996). LLNL built a 46 cm2 single cell Nafion-based LTPEM URFC and completed 
testing to match the work completed by GE in the 1970s, and explore operational parameters 

such as temperature and current density. Operating at pressures below 160 psi, LLNL was able to 

achieve over 2000 cycles with less than 50 mV of degradation, which is equivalent to less than a 
few percent. LLNL was able to demonstrate high current operation (greater than 1 A/cm2) in 
both fuel cell and electrolysis mode using an improved cell design with a lower resistance 
membrane (Mitlitsky, Myers, & Weisberg, 1998). LLNL also developed a URFC concept to 

power small spacecraft, much like the original GE application. Called the Integrated Modular 

Propulsion and Regenerative Electro-Energy Storage System (IMPRESS), the concept combined 

the URFC stack with a hydrogen/oxygen propulsion system to reduce spacecraft mass (Mitlitsky, 

de Groot, Butler, & McElroy, 1996). The IMPRESS concept gained the attention of the Air 

Force as a potentially beneficial efficiency improvement for satellite operations (Coalson, 1996). 

NASA and the DOE also funded private electrochemical companies to develop unitized 

regenerative fuel cell stack hardware. Proton Energy Systems was one such company. Proton 
worked with LLNL on testing their URFC stacks, first matching the 46 cm2 format before 
doubling the area to 92 cm2 (see Figure 3). These units operated at a pressure of 400 psi, 

6 

 
 
allowing for higher system energy density by minimizing reactant storage volume without the 

need for mechanical pumping. A DOE report generated from a Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell 

Workshop in 2011 showed that Proton continued to develop both discrete and unitized RFC 

technology for much of the previous decade (Remick & Wheeler, 2011). Proton developed a 

URFC stack under the product line UNIGEN to satisfy multiple applications that require long 

endurance, high energy density power systems. Those applications include a zero-gravity URFC 

concept under the DARPA Water Rocket program that would work much like the IMPRESS 

concept from LLNL, a terrestrial URFC serving as a backup UPS, and energy storage devices for 

the electrical grid. The UNIGEN technology demonstrated over 1,000 cycles with 37% round 

trip efficiency in 2003 (Remick & Wheeler, 2011) but has not found a use in commercial 

applications (Wang Y. , A review on unitized regenerative fuel cell technologies, Part-A: 

Unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cells, 2016).

Multiple organizations have filed patents on LTPEM URFC technology (see Figure 4). 
Hydrogenics Corp. filed a patent for a URFC with a bifunctional humidifier in 2004 (USA Patent 

No. 6,833,207 B2, 2004). The design is unitized in the sense that the physical stack is only one 

piece of hardware but includes individual fuel cell and electrolyzer sections sharing a single 

interface plate. The patent claims include the ability to perform rapid transitions between fuel 

cell and electrolyzer modes, to provide instantaneous full-power operation, and to reduce system 

components. Despite these benefits, the system would not provide the mass and volume savings 

of fully unitized RFC stack designs in lightweight applications. Giner Inc. has filed patents on 

unitized RFC technology, focusing on methods to improve water separation in the unitized stack 

through what is called a Water Management Membrane (WaMM) (USA Patent No. 9,595,727 

B2, 2017). The WaMM provides a means of transporting water to the cell during electrolysis and 

7 

 
 
 
 
removing water during fuel cell power generation by maintaining water in the vapor phase. This 

method also allows for rapid transitions between modes. The concepts developed by 

Hydrogenics and Giner appear to be technically successful but have not been developed into 

commercial products available for integration into mobile power applications.

Energy Systems and b) Lynntech, Inc. (Burke, Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell Development,

NASA had been scheduled to demonstrate LTPEM RFC hardware in a solar-powered, high-

altitude aircraft for a long endurance flight under the Environmental Research Aircraft and 

Sensor Technology (ERAST) project in 2003. After a gate review in late 2001, the unitized RFC 

hardware was abandoned in favor of a primary fuel cell only version. The URFC under 

development had not been “working reliably” and it would not be ready for the demonstration 

with the schedule and budgetary restraints of the program (Noll, et al., 2004). NASA continued 

developing RFC technology after the conclusion of the program but focused on discrete system 

designs instead. A closed loop RFC using Lynntech fuel cell and electrolyzer hardware was built 

and demonstrated for the first time at NASA Glenn Research Center in 2003 (Bents, 2007). 

Testing continued into 2005, demonstrating operation at the full power rating of 15 kW 

electrolysis / 5 kW fuel cell, five continuous charge-discharge cycles, and fully automated 

controls. 

Studies on using URFCs for long duration power systems by NASA and other organizations 

continued after the ERAST program ended. A NASA study in 2006 on HALE for science and 

communication applications showed that solar-RFC hybrid propulsion systems are only 

attractive in applications with longer (multiple week) cycle times (Nickol, Guynn, Kohout, & 

Ozoroski, 2006). Only discrete RFC systems were analyzed because URFC technology was 

8 

 
 
 
 
considered not mature enough to be included as a viable option on the projected application 

development timeline. 

Boeing and Ishikawajima-Karima Heavy Industries (IHI) completed a demonstration on a 

regenerative fuel cell system onboard a Boeing aircraft in 2012 under the Boeing 

ecoDemonstrator program (Okaya, Arastu, & Breit, Regenerative Fuel Cell (RFC) for High 

Power Space System Applications, 2013) (Carlo, 2014), see Figure 5. The RFC was designed to 

be an auxiliary power unit (APU) for the aircraft and has a discrete RFC configuration rather 

than a unitized stack. Calculations of the performance of the RFC system showed that it was 

capable of 300 Wh/kg for a 15 to 30 kW system. To our knowledge, an RFC, unitized or 

discrete, has not been integrated into an aerial application beyond this demonstration.

2.2.1.2 Cell design and material research 
Many research organizations have attempted to address the performance issues related to 

unitized RFC stack materials and designs. New oxygen electrode materials have been reviewed 

due to the accelerated degradation observed in this area during extended operation and cyclic 

mode switching. Degradation in URFCs appears to be driven by the oxygen reactions, especially 

in electrolysis mode, making the choice of designs and materials in this region critical to a 

9 

 
 
 
 
successful LTPEM URFC (Sadhasivam, et al., 2017). Catalyst materials must be bifunctional, 

meaning that they remain active in both fuel cell and electrolysis operation. The carbon-based 

materials typically used for catalyst supports, diffusion layers, and bipolar plates in fuel cell 

mode must be replaced because they are not stable during electrolysis. Various passive water 

management structures and materials have been incorporated into the cell to simplify water 

delivery to and removal from the cell without the need for extensive external equipment. 

2.2.1.2.1 
URFC electrode configuration can take two different approaches to reversibility. The most 

Catalysts 

common approach is to dedicate each electrode to an individual reactant species, hydrogen or 

oxygen. This simplifies gas management when switching between operational modes, but places 

significant stress on electrode materials by forcing them to operate across a wide voltage range. 

The second approach is to dedicate each electrode to either reduction reactions or oxidation 

reactions independent of operating mode. This has the potential to maximize efficiency of the 

reactions in a unitized cell, but complicates gas management and the mode transition process. 

Many institutions have researched bifunctional catalysts for URFCs. A typical approach includes 

combining catalyst materials that perform well in fuel cell reactions with other catalyst materials 

that perform well in the electrolysis reaction on the same electrode. Combinations of platinum, 

ruthenium, iridium, and their oxides are most commonly used (Sadhasivam, et al., 2017) (Wang 

Y. , A review on unitized regenerative fuel cell technologies, Part-A: Unitized regenerative 

proton exchange membrane fuel cells, 2016) (Wang, et al., 2018). Methods of combining the 

catalyst include homogenous mixing, layering, or segmented catalyst sections in a single layer. 

Platinum-iridium mixtures have been identified as an efficient catalyst on both a dedicated 

oxygen electrode and as a dedicated oxidation electrode. A collaboration between the University 
of Paris and Kurchatov Institute demonstrated a two-cell, 250 cm2 URFC stack with a layered Pt-
Ir catalyst as the oxidation catalyst. Performance was stable although inferior to dedicated PEM 

fuel cell and electrolyzer units (Ranjbari, Millet, Grigoriev, & Fateev, 2010). A research group at 

Santa Clara University used a layered approach of Pt-black and IrRu oxide in the oxygen 

electrode of their URFC singe cell design (Lele, 2016).  

2.2.1.2.2 
Titanium has become the material of choice for components in contact with the oxygen side due 

Diffusion layers and plates 

to the high corrosion resistance of the material. Contact resistance issues may arise with titanium 

due to the propensity of the material to form a passive oxide layer on the surface. Modifying the 

form of the titanium or coating the titanium with a conductive layer helps to mitigate the contact 

resistance problem. The Energy Research Center of the Netherlands examined porous titanium 

10 

 
 
gas diffusion layers and supports for the oxygen electrode in 2004 (Grootjes & Makkus, 2004). 

Incorporated with a platinum-iridium oxygen catalyst, they were able to demonstrate stable 

operation in a small, single cell test over tens of hours. Sintered titanium electrodes and titanium 

flow field plates electroplated with gold were used in the URFC cell from Santa Clara (Lele, 

2016). Researchers at the University of South Carolina demonstrated that titanium bipolar plates 

with electrochemically deposited platinum greatly reduced corrosion when compared to a 

carbon-based plate, while maintaining sufficient electrical conductivity (Jung H.-Y. , 2009). 

2.2.1.2.3 
Passive water management schemes for URFCs are necessary to maintain a low mass system that 

Water management 

can handle both operating modes. They have often employed wicking structures and materials, 

much like the WaMM developed by Giner. A unitized cell design known as Passive Unitized 

Regenerative Fuel Cell developed at Santa Clara University employs a two-stage porous polymer 

wicking element to remove water during fuel cell mode and supply water during electrolysis 
through capillary action (Lele, 2016). The first attempt at demonstrating the concept with a 5 cm2 
single cell prototype was built, but the performance struggled at higher current densities. The rate 

of water generated or consumed in the original design outpaced the maximum transport rate of 

the capillary forces in the wicking structure. A second design attempted to shorten the capillary 

transport length by removing or supplying water at the center of the cell but was not successful 

during experimental testing. 

The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) explored URFCs paired with solar power 

for remote area power supplies (Doddathimmaiah & Andrews, 2006) as a way to reduce costs. 
Using URFC LTPEM MEAs supplied by Lynntech, RMIT built a 10 cm2 single cell test unit 
with an integrated reservoir to manage water delivery to and from the cell for each operational 

mode. The unitized cell performance matched that of a standalone electrolyzer but was much less 

efficient than a standalone fuel cell stack. 

Others have tried to handle water management issues through novel control schemes and mode 

transition sequences. Switching from electrolysis to fuel cell mode is particularly difficult 

because the electrodes can become flooded with water, preventing the reactions from occurring 

and causing a failure to start power production (Liu, Guo, Yuan, & Ye, 2018). Two-phase flow 

consisting of liquid water and oxygen gas occurs during this transition, where the drag force of 

the oxygen flowing into the unitized stack must clear the water droplets from the surface of the 

oxygen electrode. A delay time before drawing power must be incorporated into the mode 

transition so that the water can be cleared. Other beneficial mitigation techniques for the 

11 

 
 
transition include temporarily increasing the cell temperature to evaporate water or limiting the 

power of the stack until enough water is cleared (Liu, Guo, Yuan, & Ye, 2018). 

2.2.1.2.4 
Some research organizations have been able to advance their URFC concepts to the level of 

Multi-cell stacks 

larger area, multi-cell stacks. A group at the South China University of Technology built a 

microscale URFC system complete with hydrogen gas storage and balance of plant components 
centered around a 6-cell, 28.5 cm2 LTPEM URFC stack (Su, Liao, & Xu, 2009). The system 
went through 10 cycles of operation without degradation but was only capable of a low current 

density due to hydrogen storage limitations. Takasago Thermal Engineering built and 

demonstrated a 100W LTPEM URFC stack with 17 cells for the Japanese Aerospace Exploration 

Agency (Sone, 2011). The Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 

Technology tested a 10-cell version of this stack from Takasago in a pilot application for 

combined heat and power known as the Totalized Hydrogen Energy Utilization System. Their 

testing and analysis showed that heat recovery could increase the round trip efficiency of the 

system above 60% (Ito, Miyazaki, & Nakano, 2016) (Bhogilla, Ito, Kato, & Nakano, 2016). The 
University of Paris/Kurchatov Institute collaboration built a 7-cell, 256 cm2 LTPEM URFC stack 
using dedicated reduction/oxidation electrodes capable of 500W in fuel cell mode with a 30% 

round trip efficiency in short term testing (Grigoriev, Millet, Porembsky, & Fateev, 2011). To 

date, no organization or institution has demonstrated a LTPEM URFC system that can deliver 

power above 1 kW. 

2.2.2  Solid oxide RFCs (RSOFCs) 

SOFC technology has generated interest for use in mobile applications in recent years. SOFC 

technology can trace its origins to 1897 when Nernst developed the Nernst lamp, an incandescent 

lamp that used a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) filament (Mobius, 1997). The material is a 
natural choice for a fuel cell electrolyte material because it is a mixed oxide solid solution that 

allows for oxide ion conduction at elevated temperatures (500-1000°C). Research into solid 
electrolyte cells proceeded slowly for the first half of the 20th century, with the first use of 
zirconia-based ceramics in tubular fuel cells in 1937 and in planar cells in the 1950s. Companies 

such as General Electric and Westinghouse began collecting patents and developing SOFCs for 

potential power generation applications.  

Recent development of SOFC technology in the industry has focused on new and improved 

electrolytes and electrode materials to reduce cost, simplify manufacturing, and increase 

durability and lifetime. SOFC manufacturing and supply chains are not as advanced as PEM but 

continue to develop to the point where the technology is reaching the marketplace in a handful of 

12 

 
 
applications. SOFCs have begun to enter the market as stationary power systems in the kW to 

MW range and as kW-scale auxiliary power units for vehicles in both commercial and military 

applications. 

2.2.2.1 SOEC and RSOFC Research 
Interest in using solid oxide electrochemical technology as a reversible fuel cell system 

originated from research into solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). High temperature electrolysis 

processes were viewed as a potential way to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production 

processes beyond the efficiency found in alkaline technology that was, and largely remains, the 

industry standard (Gomez & Hotza, 2016). Researchers at Dornier, a German aircraft company, 

engaged in development of high temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells as early as the 

1970s. In 1987, they began researching their technology for use in fuel cells as well. 

Experimental testing of both modes on a 10-cell tubular stack operating at 1000°C revealed that 

zirconia-based solid oxide electrochemical cells “can be reversibly changed from the electrolysis 

mode to the fuel cell mode and vice versa without any discontinuity,” (Erdle, Donitz, Schamm, 

& Koch, 1992). They immediately recognized the importance of this observation, noting that 

“this technology offers the potential of establishing a regenerative fuel cell system for electrical 

energy storage applications, where the fuel cell and the electrolysis function are combined in 

only one unit,” (Erdle, Donitz, Schamm, & Koch, 1992). Kansai Electric Power Company and 
Mitsubishi developed and tested a 750 cm2 planar version of the technology at around the same 
time to be paired with a nuclear power plant as an energy storage device (Wang Y. , A review on 

unitized regenerative fuel cell technologies, part B: unitized regenerative alkaline fuel cell, solid 

oxide fuel cell, and microfluidic fuel cell, 2016) (Shimaki, et al., 1992) (Kusunoki, et al., 1995). 

Much like LTPEM technologies, the challenge in creating a reversible fuel cell technology that 

can handle a wide operating voltage range over multiple mode cycles is in selecting the right 

combination of materials in the electrodes and electrolyte. RSOFCs have had difficulty finding 

their way into applications despite a superior round trip efficiency because the electrolyte and 

electrode materials chosen have shown poor long-term stability and cycle life (Wang Y. , A 

review on unitized regenerative fuel cell technologies, part B: unitized regenerative alkaline fuel 

cell, solid oxide fuel cell, and microfluidic fuel cell, 2016) (Gomez & Hotza, 2016). YSZ 

remains the most popular electrolyte for RSOFC research, but other oxide ion conducting 

electrolytes such as scandium oxide stabilized zirconium (ScSZ), Lanthanum Strontium Gallium 

Magnesium Oxide (LSGM), samaria-doped ceria (SDC), and gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) 

have also been employed. A blend of nickel and the electrolyte material is commonly used on the 

hydrogen electrode, but is particularly susceptible to oxidation during electrolysis mode, 

resulting in a reduction in activity and delamination from the electrolyte. Lanthanum strontium 

13 

 
 
manganite (LSM) is commonly used for the oxygen electrode but has similar degradation issues 

to the hydrogen electrode in electrolysis mode. Cycling between operating modes and operating 
at high current densities (> 500 mA/cm2) appear to accelerate degradation problems in these 
materials. 

2.2.2.1.1 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Energy Technology Laboratory 

Materials Research 

explored various combinations of electrode materials with a YSZ electrolyte to form an RSOFC 

(Marina, et al., 2007). Nickel/zirconia cermet (Ni/YSZ) and LSM/ceria composites were used as 

hydrogen electrodes. Lanthanum strontium ferrite (LSF), lanthanum strontium copper ferrite 

(LSCuF), lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCoF), and LSM were used as oxygen electrodes. 
Single cell tests were performed on a 33.6 cm2 cell to observe electrochemical behavior in both 
fuel cell and electrolysis modes. Ni/YSZ and LSCoF were found to be the optimal material 

combination, but still showed high resistance during electrolysis at 750°C. 

Researchers at the European Institute for Energy Research (EIFER) performed high temperature 

solid oxide water electrolysis studies by operating an SOFC in reverse with Ni/YSZ and LSM 
electrodes and YSZ electrolyte (Brisse, Schefold, & Zahid, 2008). 45 cm2 single cell testing at 
800 and 900°C proceeded with fuel cell operation for four days, followed by electrolysis 

experiments totaling 160 hours of operation, without any signs of degradation. The unit was not 

continuously cycled between modes as it would be in an RFC application, which could 

significantly accelerate degradation mechanisms. 

The University of Science and Technology of China took the approach of changing the 

electrolyte from YSZ to BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.2O3-δ, a proton-conducting material (He, Song, Peng, 

Meng, & Yang, 2010). Using a proton-conducting electrolyte provides the advantages of 

producing pure hydrogen without the need for separation and lowering the activation energy at 

moderate temperatures for ionic conduction in solid oxide technologies (600-700°C). Single cells 
with less than 1 cm2 active area were fabricated and tested reversibly in SOFC and SOEC mode, 
showing variations in performance with steam concentration in SOEC. SOFC performance of 

this cell appeared inferior to LTPEM fuel cell technologies. No cycle life testing was completed. 

A group at Yuan Ze University in Taiwan developed an RSOFC with a NiO/YSZ, YSZ, 
LSM/YSZ configuration (Jung, et al., 2016). Single cell testing was performed on a 5 cm2 cell. 
Addition of YSZ into the LSM oxygen electrode increased SOEC performance but decreased 

SOFC performance. Cyclic durability testing showed that the performance in fuel cell mode 

degraded 10% in 10 cycles corresponding to an increase in ohmic resistance of the cell arising 

from delamination of the electrode and electrolyte layers. 

14 

 
 
Researchers at Kyushu University in Japan experimented with an RSOFC stack configuration 

consisting of an LSGM electrolyte, an LSF cathode, and a Ba0.6La0.4CoO3 (BLC) anode 

(Ishihara, 2017). Testing was performed in both electrolysis-only mode and in cyclic operation 

between electrolysis and fuel cell modes. The LSF material showed no signs of degradation in 

electrochemical characteristics or physical appearance after 40 cycles. The material did show 

promise as a reversible fuel cell material but is noted to be not as conductive as materials used in 

dedicated fuel cells or electrolyzers. 

A complete summary of materials combinations attempted in RSOFC research can be found in 

comprehensive review articles on RSOFC cell development provided in the references (Wang Y. 

, A review on unitized regenerative fuel cell technologies, part B: unitized regenerative alkaline 

fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell, and microfluidic fuel cell, 2016) (Gomez & Hotza, 2016). 

2.2.2.1.2 
A consortium of Spanish researchers and St Andrews in the UK developed a “symmetrical” 

Symmetric Cell Designs 

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SSOFC) concept where the same electrode material is used on both the 

anode and cathode, as well as the electrical interconnects (Ruiz-Morales, Marrero-Lopez, 

Canales-Vasquez, & Irvine, 2011). This approach would greatly simplify the manufacturing 

process for an SOFC/SOEC cell by allowing for a single thermal treatment step. Both SOFC and 

SOEC studies were performed, making them a candidate for an RSOFC. Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ was 

identified as the best candidate for a symmetric RSOFC, but no manufacturing or experimental 

work was completed with the material. 

NASA developed a symmetric RSOFC design concept that used YSZ electrolyte with Ni-YSZ 

electrode and replaced the metallic interconnects with a thin LaCaCrO3 (LCC) layer (Cable, 

Setlock, Farmer, & Eckel, 2009). System design analysis of this stack in a UAV HALE 

application showed that the interconnect material replacement could reduce the stack mass by 

40%, achieving a power density far superior to PEM or internal combustion-based power 

systems for the application. A novel manufacturing technique known as freeze-casting was used 

to create Ni-YSZ electrodes with built-in micro-channels to boost performance in electrolysis 

mode by enhancing gas diffusion through the cell. Degradation testing showed mixed results, 

with stable performance in electrolysis mode but accelerated degradation of 20-30% per 1000 

hours when cycling between operational modes. 

2.2.2.2 Multi-cell RSOFC Stacks 
Some multi-cell RSOFC stacks have been built and tested but have often been plagued by 
degradation problems. General Electric was able to build and test 3-cell and 10-cell, 200 cm2 
stacks (as shown in Figure 6a) with Ni/YSZ hydrogen electrodes, YSZ electrolytes, and 

15 

 
 
lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) oxygen electrodes that performed water electrolysis 
and methane reforming in fuel cell mode (Minh, 2011). The 3rd cell in the 3-cell stacks showed 
rapid degradation by resistance increases associated with the increase in contact 

electrode/interconnect resistance from chromium and strontium migration. The 10-cell stack 

produced over 6 SLM of H2 in electrolysis mode with 1110 W of DC power at 800°C using a 

70% H2O / 30% H2 feed. The 10-cell stack was able to operate for over 1000 hours with two 

total cycles and 100-400 hours per operating mode but showed accelerated degradation during 

electrolysis. 

Figure 6. RSOFC multi-cell stack hardware by a) General Electric, 10-cell, 200 cm2 and b) 
Korea Institute of Science and Technology, 3-cell, 100 cm2, 200W 

The Julich Institute of Energy and Climate Research developed an RSOFC based on a Ni/YSZ, 
YSZ, and LSCF configuration (Nguyen, Fang, Packbier, & Blum, 2013). They built a 2-cell, 80 
cm2 stack and completed 4000 hours of fuel cell testing along with over 4000 hours of steam 
electrolysis and co-electrolysis of steam and CO2 at various conditions. Minimal degradation was 

observed in both fuel cell and steam electrolysis modes, with higher degradation during co-

electrolysis and at higher current densities. The results show that the Julich cell design is 

promising for an RSOFC, although testing did not feature any cycling between fuel cell and 

electrolysis operational modes. 

The Korea Institute of Science and Technology developed and built a 3-cell, 100 cm2 RSOFC 
capable of up to 200W (see Figure 6b) (Hong, et al., 2014). The stack employed an ScSZ 

16 

 
 
 
 
electrolyte with Ni-YSZ and LSC-GDC electrodes. Stable operation in electrolysis mode was 

achieved for over 1000 hours, with less than 8% degradation achieved. Operational mode 

switching was found to greatly accelerate degradation resulting from delamination of the 

electrode and electrolyte layers. 

2.2.2.3 System Analysis 
Little analysis has been done on integrating RSOFCs into real-life applications. The Colorado 

School of Mines has investigated using a RSOFC for distributed energy storage applications in 

the range of 100 to 800 kW (Wendel & Braun, 2016). The RSOFC was considered able to handle 

a wide range of fuels, including methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide, and electrolysis 

feeds, including water and carbon dioxide. The analysis considered thermal aspects, 

configurations with other power system equipment, and operating conditions to maximize the 

overall efficiency of the system and built upon previous steady state, 1D RSOFC models based 

on a LSGM electrolyte, nickel with strontium lanthanum titanium oxide fuel electrode, and 

LSCF-GDC oxygen electrode configuration. The author of the study notes that the area-specific 

resistance of this cell at 600C is notably higher than standard LSGM or YSZ-based cells at their 

optimal temperatures. Despite that, an optimized system in this range can achieve a round trip 

efficiency of 65 to 75%. RSOFCs were found to outperform LTPEM URFCs for these 

applications if water could be kept in the vapor phase and the cycle time was over 8 hours. 

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed a theoretical system model of an RSOFC for 

energy storage applications (Sanatham, Heddrich, Riedel, & Friedrich, 2017). The energy system 

employed thermal energy storage to help maximize overall system efficiency when switching 

between fuel cell and electrolysis modes. A “commercially available” 10-cell, 300W RSOFC 

stack was tested as part of this work to provide experimental data in both fuel cell and 

electrolysis mode for comparison with the analysis. The stack could operate at up to 115 psi with 

an open-air electrode and consisted of a LSCF-GDC/YSZ/Ni-GDC electrode/electrolyte 

configuration. Analysis and experiments showed that a roundtrip efficiency of 55% was possible 

with this stack, better than what has been achieved with LTPEM. 

Both system analyses described above were for larger-scale stationary applications. Solid oxide 

technologies do have some characteristics that make mobile applications difficult, such as high 

temperature operation, relative fragility to forces and vibrations, and long startup times. 

2.2.3  High temperature PEM RFC 

HTPEM fuel cells have been under research and development as an alternative fuel cell 

technology with potential operational benefits for specific applications. HTPEM technology uses 

17 

 
 
alternate membrane materials that can conduct protons at temperatures in the range of 150-

200°C, above the 100°C limit of Nafion found in LTPEM technology. The higher operational 

temperature enables HTPEM technology to use dirtier fuels without significant performance 

penalties, eliminates liquid water reactant/product management issues, and provides potential 

efficiency improvements in an RFC from the thermal effects. The most common and mature 

HTPEM membrane material is polybenzimidazole (PBI), a fibrous material first manufactured in 

the 1960s and used by NASA and the Air Force for thermal protection applications. Doping PBI 

with phosphoric acid gives the material proton conductivity, an idea that was first introduced by 

researchers at Case Western Reserve University in the 1990s (Wainright, Wang, Weng, Savinell, 

& Litt, 1995). PBI and other proton-conducting membranes have been a subject of research and 

development for the past twenty years to the point of manufacturing kW-scale stacks. However, 

HTPEM technology has not found much use in actual power system applications to date. 

HTPEM electrolysis has been explored by researchers, but to a lesser extent than power 

production. Investigation has been limited to theoretical system studies and catalyst research 

(Goni-Urtiaga, Presvytes, & Scott, 2012) (Xu, Ma, Li, Zhao, & Zhongxue, 2012) (Nikiforov, et 

al., 2012). This means that a unitized PEMFC stack based on this or similar technology in the 

intermediate temperature range (100-300°C) has not been explored. HTPEM systems have been 

considered as the fuel cell portion of a discrete RFC system. CMR Prototech and the European 

Space Agency (ESA) have developed a concept for a discrete RFC with a HTPEM fuel cell and 

LTPEM electrolyzer to replace batteries for long-term operation of geostationary orbit 

telecommunication satellites (Farnes, et al., 2017). Although progress was made on hardware for 

each operational mode, the system has not been integrated and operated as a single unit. 

2.3  Aircraft application and technology selection 

2.3.1  Aircraft applications 

We studied the advantages of developing a URFC system as either an electric propulsion device 

for an all-electric aircraft or hybrid auxiliary power unit (APU) for use in a Boeing 787 

passenger aircraft. This URFC system will be designed with enough reactant storage to support 

one, two, or five hours of operation in fuel cell mode. The advantage of the URFC in this 

scenario is that energy storage and power generation are independent of each other, thus the 

same 125 kW power source can be used in a 125 kWh, 250 kWh, and 625 kWh energy storage 

system. The URFC in the Boeing 787 is expected to be hybridized with the present generator that 

composed the current APU. The APU in the Boeing 787 is used to provide ground power and 

serves as backup power in flight. The URFC component of the auxiliary power unit would 

18 

 
 
produce 125 kW of power and thus it could be used as a building block for other more-electric 

aircraft applications like electric propulsion. For the APU, the proposed system would consist of 

two URFCs systems working with one half of the current Boeing 787 APU. It is envisioned that 

the hybrid APU for the Boeing 787 would require 125 kWh of storage whereas a more-electric 

aircraft requiring electric propulsion would utilize the 625 kWh of storage. For the Boeing 787 

application, the aircraft may operate on a single URFC to provide ground power and thus 

maximize aircraft fuel efficiency.  

2.3.2  Selected technology and rationale 

In reviewing the technology available, we have proposed one based on HTPEM technology for 

the development of a URFC system. An issue that is common to all URFC systems is supporting 

two electrochemical reactions on the same surface. In charge mode, a fuel cell cathode, which 
would traditionally electrochemically reduce oxygen to water, would also need to oxidize water 

to oxygen. Although catalysts for a reversible electrode as described exist, the electrode structure 

to support the reaction would require development to ensure consistent and durable performance. 

In a LTPEM fuel cell, liquid water is a byproduct of the fuel cell reaction. Thus, the electrode 

structure of the cathode in a LTPEM fuel cell would be required to remove the fuel cell product 

water during a discharge event and accept water during a charge event. The cathode electrode 

structure in a traditional LTPEM fuel cell is designed to expel water. This electrode structure 

would not readily accept water during a charge event. The water byproduct in a HTPEM fuel cell 

is in a gas phase. This allows for a simpler electrode structure when considering the requirement 

for a reversible electrode. This approach would be similar to SOFC-based URFC systems. One 

advantage of a HTPEM-based versus a SOFC-based URFC is that the HTPEM allows for 

multiple stop-start cycles without damage to the stack hardware. The HTPEM-based URFC also 

allows for pressurization, allowing for more compact reactant storage when taking the entire 

URFC fuel cell system into consideration.

System design 

3.1  Scope statement 

Teledyne has proposed an energy storage system design using a unitized regenerative PEM fuel 

cell stack to support an aircraft application. A system piping and instrumentation diagram 

(P&ID), list of components, and list of operational parameters have been composed to define the 

system that has been studied and modeled in the simulations described in Section 4. The system 

19 

 
 
defined in the following section reflects what was within the scope of the energy storage system 

and what was excluded from the analysis. 

3.1.1  Within scope 

Teledyne has developed a system design that encompasses components relevant to simulating the 

unitized RFC system in aircraft applications. Only items that are critical to evaluating the 

operation of the system for performance purposes are included. The list of components and 

supporting information includes the following: 

•  Unitized fuel cell stack 
•  Reactant storage tanks 
•  Thermal control system 
•  Valves/devices for pressure/flow control 
•  Control logic 
•  CONOPS for system startup/shutdown 

The system piping and interface diagram is shown in Appendix A and the bill of materials is 
listed in Appendix B. 

3.1.2  Outside of scope 

Items that are not necessary for evaluating the performance of the system are eliminated from 

consideration in this study. This will enable a proper assessment of the merits of the system prior 

to investing resources into developing a fully mature system design. The list of components to be 

excluded is as follows: 

Items for physical mounting (brackets, fasteners, structural members) 

•  Power conditioning equipment 
• 
•  Wiring 
•  Controller design 
•  Ground support equipment and infrastructure 
•  Connections to existing aircraft equipment 

3.2  System components and features 

This section defines the major system components shown in Appendix A and Appendix B along 

with the assumptions behind the design decisions and a general description of how each 

component operates. The unitized fuel cell system developed under this program employs 

creative ideas that make it a unique concept for a regenerative fuel cell system. Passive controls 

were employed as much as possible to maximize the reliability and simplify operation. The 

system also represents the most volumetrically dense regenerative fuel cell system of its type by 

20 

 
 
incorporating a unitized stack design within a reactant storage vessel. The combination of these 

attributes makes the system an attractive option for aerial applications. 

3.2.1  Unitized fuel cell stack 

The regenerative fuel cell stack (RFC1) produces power in fuel cell mode and generates 

hydrogen and oxygen reactants in electrolysis mode. While operating in fuel cell mode the stack 

receives a supply of hydrogen and oxygen, converts them into power, water, and heat. When 

running in electrolysis mode, the stack receives a supply of water and electrical power, produces 

hydrogen and oxygen, and generates heat as a byproduct. 

HTPEM technology was chosen for the aircraft electric propulsion application. For the duration 
of each operational cycle, the system will maintain a high operating temperature of 160ºC to  
180ºC. Operating at such temperatures ensures the product water remains in gaseous phase while 
avoiding the large thermal energy input required for fuel cell technologies that operate at much 
higher temperatures (> 600ºC). An external thermal control system will control the operating 
temperature with a liquid coolant loop and ambient air supply.  

The fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) design will consist of a commercially 

available PBI-membrane, for which performance data is publicly available. The stack will be 

sized to meet the full power condition of 125 kW. Using the best available performance data 

from MEAs of this design (Advent High Temperature Membrane Electrode Assemblies, 2019), 
the fuel cell stack will consist of 400 cells with 844 cm2 of active area for each cell. The stack 
will produce 125 kW at 233.1 VDC and 541 A and encompass a physical envelope of 30.5 cm by 

106.7 cm by 223.5 cm (726.8 L). 

The unitized stack will consist of an open cathode design, which are typically employed in air-

breathing fuel cells as a method of eliminating oxidant gas storage and simplifying flow control. 

The fuel cell stack will be horizontally mounted within the oxygen tank to take advantage of 

these beneficial attributes for aircraft applications. Excess water vapor allowed to cool below  
100ºC will condense on the walls of the tank and collect in the clearance space below the 
mounted fuel cell stack. 

3.2.2  Reactant storage tanks 

The reactant storage tanks contain pressurized hydrogen and oxygen gas that is consumed by the 

unitized stack in fuel cell mode and refilled with reactants during electrolysis mode. The reactant 

tanks were sized with a 20% margin to account for worst-case energy use and unforeseen 

circumstances during flight missions. The hydrogen tanks were sized for the individual missions 

21 

 
 
to allow consideration of weight and volume in optimizing the system design while the oxygen 

tank volume is fixed to account for internal housing of the fuel cell system. The tanks will be 

manufactured with carbon fiber in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) design of 

type III to minimize their weight. Type III COPVs employ a metal liner, usually aluminum, 

around which the fibers are wrapped. This approach is quite common for lightweight pressure 

vessel designs used for man-portable and fuel cell vehicle applications. 

The hydrogen tanks were designed to employ high-pressure hydrogen storage of a maximum 

value of 20,684 kPa (3000 psi) to minimize the required volume per unit mass. For a one-hour 

flight in the electric propulsion application, the hydrogen tank will have a volume of 790 L and 

hold 7.76 kg of hydrogen. During a two-hour flight mission, the tank will have a volume of 1460 

L and hold 14.3 kg of hydrogen. A five-hour flight mission requires 34.5 kg of hydrogen stored 

in a tank with a volume of 3510 L. Tank mass was determined by using an industry derived 

metric of 0.75 lbs./L (Legault, 2012). 

The hydrogen holding tank V3 was implemented to help balance the stack pressure during 

electrolysis mode to account for varying reactant production rates within the stack. The tank will 

hold hydrogen until the pressure differential between the hydrogen and oxygen volumes builds to 

+15 psi (103 kPa). A compressor will transfer the reactant to the main hydrogen storage tank V1. 

As hydrogen builds at a steady rate of 1154 SLM, a small volume of gas will be held in V3 while 

the pressure builds. The tank was sized to a volume of 400 L of gas capable of containing the 

maximum storage pressure achievable in the main hydrogen storage tank. 

The oxygen tank is required to store the fuel cell stack that encompasses a physical envelope of 

0.30 m by 1.07 m by 2.24 m. The tank was sized to be 2.44 m long with a diameter of 1.27 m for 

a total volume of 3089 L and net internal volume of 2692 L that is not filled by the fuel cell 

stack. In addition to the internally mounted stack, the oxygen tank houses a heating element to 

evaporate product water during fuel cell mode and excess supply water during electrolysis mode. 

The oxygen tank dimensions account for the recirculation fan required to maintain proper 

reactant flow and water vapor supply during both operational modes. The oxygen tank will have 

a maximum volume of 2700 L capable of holding 362 kg of oxygen at a maximum storage 

pressure of 15,168 kPa (2200 psi) when filled completely. The tank will only store the required 

amount of reactant needed to complete specific flight durations. During a one-hour flight 

mission, the tank will hold 61 kg of oxygen at a maximum pressure of 2,758 kPa (400 psi). For a 

two-hour flight mission, the tank will hold 114 kg of oxygen at a maximum pressure of 5,000 

kPa (725 psi). A five-hour flight mission requires 274 kg of oxygen at a maximum pressure of 

11,721 kPa (1700 psi).  

22 

 
 
Both tanks will include pressure and temperature monitoring (PT1, PT3, T1, T2) to ensure that 

they are in safe operating regimes for the duration of operation. The hydrogen tank will include 

isolation valves, a manual valve/check valve assembly for external pressurization, and a relief 

valve in case of over pressurization. The oxygen tank will include a water fill and drain port as 

well as liquid level monitoring to ensure that the tank does not become flooded with water. 

3.2.3  Thermal control system 

The thermal control system will be sized to heat the fuel cell prior to start-up and to reject heat 

for the duration of flight missions. The system will contain a 170 L carbon fiber water tank (V4) 

with a 9-kW heating element (HT1) to achieve initial temperature requirements. A multistage 

centrifugal pump (P3) will be set to a constant flowrate to circulate the coolant stream during 

fuel cell and electrolysis modes. For in-flight temperature control, the system will utilize an air-
cooled heat exchanger (HX1) to reject heat from the coolant stream. A variable frequency drive 

(VFD1) will control the speed of the direct drive fan to adjust the air flow rate traveling through 

the heat exchanger.  

The coolant tank will be manufactured to incorporate a flange-style immersion heater (HT1) 

from the top of the vessel. The dimensions of the tank were sized to fully submerge the 76.2 cm 
heating element HT1 required to heat the fuel cell system to 160ºC prior to operation. The level 
switch (LS1) will monitor the liquid level and temperature in the tank while serving as an alarm 

when the tank volume is too high or low for operation. The water pump (P3) has a maximum 

flow rate of 113.5 LPM and specialized mechanical seals to withstand high operating 

temperatures. The pump is equipped with a 3-phase, totally enclosed and fan controlled 60 Hz 

motor that can operate at a maximum of 3550 RPM. There will be a flow switch (FS1) located at 

the outlet of P3 to monitor the flow and temperature of the coolant stream for pump failure.  

An air-cooled heat exchanger (HX1) will rely on the ambient air supply at high altitudes in flight 

and an external air blower on the ground during electrolysis mode. The exchanger has been sized 

to 0.23 m x 0.61 m x 0.61 m and contains eighty tubes in a 16 by 5 arrangement with a diameter 

of 2.5 cm for coolant flow. There will be a 0.61 m x 0.61 m direct drive fan mounted on the 

larger face of the heat exchanger to force air flow through the tube bundles. The speed of the 

direct drive fan will be controlled by a 3-phase, 746 W variable frequency drive to control the 

airflow traveling through the bundles. 

The amount of heat generated within the fuel cell stack changes as the system fulfills various 

power levels through flight missions. At 25% of full power or 31.25 kW, the system generates 

33.7 kW of heat. When operating at 50% of power or 62.5 kW, the system generates 74.7 kW of 

23 

 
 
heat. At 75% of full power or 93.75 kW, the system generates 125.3 kW of heat. When the 

system is at maximum power of 125 kW, 192.4 kW of heat are generated. While operating at 

maximum power, the system requires an ambient air flow rate of 82,000 LPM to reject 192.4 kW 

of heat. As the system completes various flight missions, the ambient air flow rates will range 

from 21,200 LPM to the maximum of 82,000 LPM as required to reject heat from the system 

over the duration of a flight mission. 

During electrolysis mode, an external air blower is used to supply ambient air to HX1. As the 

system operates at constant ground power of 125 kW, the ambient air flow rate is constant during 

the reactant regeneration process. The stack generates 98 kW of heat requiring an ambient air 
flow rate of 42,000 LPM to maintain 160ºC operating temperature. The coolant flow rate is kept 
the same at 67 LPM. 

3.2.4  Valves/devices for pressure/flow control 

Several valves and flow control devices are included in the system design to safely manage the 

transfer of gas between the fuel cell stack and reactant storage tanks. They enable pressures to be 

evenly balanced between sensitive components and provide safety relief in the event of a failure 

of one or more components. The reactant flow rates generated by these devices ensure that the 

fuel cell stack is operating at optimal conditions where hydrogen, oxygen, and water are 

introduced and removed in sufficient quantity to sustain the processes. The hydrogen flow 

controls are divided into dedicated fuel cell and electrolyzer reactant flow regimes. The oxygen 

flow controls are much simpler than the hydrogen flow controls due to the open cathode stack 

configuration inside of the oxygen reactant storage tank.  

While operating in fuel cell mode, SV1 is opened to enable hydrogen reactant flow from the 

hydrogen tank (V1) to the unitized fuel cell stack (RFC1) while a check valve (CV3) prevents 

flow through electrolysis-specific components. Hydrogen flows through the forward pressure 

regulator (FPR1), which maintains the hydrogen pressure in the unitized fuel cell stack within ± 

103 kPa (15 psi) of the pressure in the oxygen tank. The hydrogen inlet line penetrates the 

oxygen vessel and connects to the unitized fuel cell stack, where the hydrogen gas is consumed 

to produce power. The remaining hydrogen gas that is not consumed exits the stack and is 

pumped through the open SV2 and another check valve (CV5) by a hydrogen recirculation pump 

(P2). The recirculation generated by the pump promotes an even distribution of hydrogen gas 

throughout the fuel cell stack, ensuring power production at higher efficiencies than that 

produced by a dead-ended stack design without active flow. 

24 

 
 
In electrolysis mode, SV1 and SV2 are closed to disable the hydrogen recirculation and pressure 

regulation components used in fuel cell mode. Hydrogen gas generated by the stack travels 

through the check valve (CV3) and is compressed (P1) to higher pressures for storage in the 

hydrogen reactant storage tank (V1). The compressor will be intermittently operated to maintain 

a balanced pressure in the stack as the gasses are generated. The difference in available gas 

volumes and in production rate from the reaction stoichiometry means that the pressures of each 

gas will build at different rates. A differential pressure transmitter (DPT2) measures the relative 

pressure between the hydrogen and oxygen regimes in the stack. When the hydrogen pressure 

exceeds the oxygen pressure by 103 kPa (15 psi), the compressor is turned on to pump hydrogen 

into reactant storage (V1) and reduce the hydrogen pressure inside the stack. The compressor is 

turned off again when the hydrogen pressure trails the oxygen pressure by 103 kPa (15 psi). A 

buffer tank (V3) is included and sized to moderate the process of turning the compressor on and 
off. 

A recirculation fan (F1) is all that is required to maintain proper reactant flow to the fuel cell or 

water vapor supply to the electrolyzer inside of the oxygen tank. The fan maintains a constant, 

steady flow of gas through the open cathode channels of the stack and ensures even mixing of 

the oxygen gas and water vapor. Maintaining flow will ensure that water vapor expelled from the 

fuel cell stack during power production will encounter the walls of the oxygen storage tank. The 

walls of the tank will be at a lower temperature than the stack, promoting condensation that will 

encourage any liquid water that forms to collect at the bottom of the tank. 

Both reactant flow loops contain mechanisms for venting hydrogen or oxygen gas out of the 

aircraft in the event of an unsafe pressure condition. RV2 and RV3 provide passive pressure 

relief in the event of a large increase in pressure. SV3 and SV4 are active venting valves that can 

assist in balancing the pressure due to a high differential in pressure. Pressure monitoring devices 

PT2, PT3, and DPT2 will enable alarms and trigger system shutdowns or other safety measures 

in the event of an unsafe pressure condition. 

3.2.5  Control logic  

The unitized RFC system was designed with the goal of utilizing as many passive controls as 

possible, which maximizes the reliability of the system while minimizing parasitic power 

required for normal operation. Four active control systems are required: stack temperature, stack 

differential pressure, hydrogen recirculation flow, and oxygen tank water level control. These 

control systems are shown in black in Figure 7 below. 

25 

 
 
 
Figure 7. P&ID with control logic: hydrogen flow, temperature, liquid level, and differential 
pressure 

3.2.5.1 Temperature control 
The temperature control scheme will be implemented to maintain optimal operating temperatures 

during fuel cell and electrolysis modes. The amount of heat rejected from the fuel cell system 

will depend on the stage of the mission profile. As the temperature fluctuates with energy 
consumption, the ambient air flow will be controlled to maintain operating temperature. The inlet 

and outlet cooling water temperatures will be measured by TC3 and TC4. The controller will 

monitor the temperature change and adjust the speed of the fan to a specific airflow rate required 

to cool the water stream to the temperature setpoint. The same control logic will be used to 

control the temperature of the system during electrolysis mode.  

3.2.5.2 Differential pressure control, electrolysis 
As the rate of hydrogen production exceeds that of oxygen, the gasses will build pressure at 

different rates. The differential pressure between the hydrogen and oxygen vessels will be 

monitored using a differential pressure transmitter (DPT2). During operation, the hydrogen 

26 

 
 
 
pressure in the holding tank (V3) will build to +103 kPa (15 psi). Once the differential pressure 

reaches that limit, DPT2 will send a signal to start the hydrogen compressor and pump hydrogen 

gas to the main reactant storage vessel (V1). When the differential pressure begins to approach -

103 kPa (15 psi), DPT2 will send a signal to the hydrogen compressor to shut down gradually. If 

the differential pressure exceeds ± 206 kPa (30 psi), an alarm will trigger a system shut down. 

The step process will continue as the reactant storage vessels produce enough gas for the next 

flight mission. 

3.2.5.3 Recirculation flow control 
The recirculation flow control is designed to provide enough flow of unconsumed hydrogen back 

into the fuel cell stack for even hydrogen distribution to sustain the reaction. The required rate of 

recirculation provided by hydrogen recirculation pump (P2) will be proportional to the current 

produced by the fuel cell stack. The fuel cell controller will increase or decrease the pump speed 

to a maximum of 1606 SLM at full power based upon the amount of current measured by a 

current sensor on the power delivery cable. The controls are deactivated for electrolysis mode 

because the recirculation flow is not required during hydrogen production. 

3.2.5.4 Oxygen tank water level control 
The water level control is designed to evaporate product water that has condensed from the 

oxygen exhaust of the unitized fuel cell stack. Water vapor must be present in the stack during 

electrolysis mode to sustain hydrogen and oxygen generation. Evaporating the product water also 

provides protection against the liquid level rising too high in the oxygen tank and submerging the 

unitized stack. A heater (HT2) is submerged in the excess liquid water inside of the oxygen tank. 

The heater will be activated when electrolysis mode commences and the liquid level in the tank 

is above 7” as measured by differential pressure transmitter DPT1. The heater will be turned off 

when the level drops below 5”. The heater can also be turned on at any time if the liquid level 

rises above 15”.  

3.3  System operation and parameters 

3.3.1  Concept of operations 

3.3.1.1 Startup procedure 
The following is the proposed concept of operations for electric propulsion flight missions 

ranging from one to five hours. The system will complete a purge cycle with inert gas supplied 

from ground resources. Once the system has been cleared of possible contaminants, the hydrogen 

and oxygen tanks will be fully pressurized to their application-specific rated capacity. The 

oxygen reactant storage tank will contain a small volume (16L or 5% above required) of liquid 

27 

 
 
water that can be electrolyzed in future cycles to provide extra capacity in the case of venting or 
losses in the system. The system will start by heating up the unitized fuel cell stack to the 160ºC 

operating temperature by turning on heater HT1 and coolant pump P3. Once the operating 

temperature has been reached, SV1 will open, allowing FPR1 to introduce more hydrogen into 

the fuel cell stack when power production begins. SV2 will open and hydrogen pump P2 will 

turn on to begin recirculating hydrogen through the stack. Once the open circuit voltage of the 

fuel cell stack is measured and verified, power can be drawn from the fuel cell stack. The startup 

heater can be turned off, allowing the air to coolant heat exchanger to handle thermal control. 

This signals the start of the normal mission profile for the electric propulsion application. 

3.3.1.2 Operational mode transition 
Once the aircraft safely completes the flight mission and powers down at the terminal, the 
unitized fuel cell can transition to electrolysis mode. The electrical output of the fuel cell system 

is electrically disconnected from the aircraft. The internal water heater HT2 is turned on to 

vaporize excess water that has condensed in the oxygen tank. The hydrogen recirculation pump 

P2 is turned off and SV2 is closed to terminate hydrogen recirculation flow. SV1 is closed to 

isolate the forward pressure regulator FPR1. The thermal control loop maintains the stack 
temperature at 160ºC by continuing recirculation of coolant and activating HT1. The ground 
water supply will connect to HV4. The air blower provided from ground resources is connected 

to the tube bundles on the air-cooled heat exchanger HX1.  

3.3.1.3 Reactant regeneration 
The unitized stack and balance of plant power supply can then be connected to ground power to 

run the electrolysis process. Once in place, power application to the unitized stack will start the 

electrolysis process. Electrolysis will proceed until all the water is consumed or one of the upper 

limits of reactant storage pressure are reached as measured by PT1 and PT3. Once the set points 

are reached, power to the unitized stack will be removed. The thermal control system will remain 
operational until the temperature of the system is lowered to less than 50ºC. The system is now 
ready for the next mission and can disconnect from all ground resources.

3.4  Safety implications 

3.4.1  Storage of the fuel cell stack in the oxygen tank 

The fuel cell system design proposed in this study takes a unique approach by placing the fuel 

cell stack inside of the oxygen tank. The major benefit of taking this approach is reducing overall 

system volume. This design also offers many benefits that improve system safety and reliability, 

such as simplifying system controls, easing the process of collecting product water, and enabling 

smoother transitions between fuel cell and electrolysis modes. The system requires fewer 

controls due to the elimination of tubing, valves, and flow control devices, with only a single 

recirculation fan needed to ensure even distribution and flow of oxygen and steam. Placing the 

stack inside of the oxygen tank takes advantage of the natural thermal gradient between the  
160ºC fuel cell stack and the environmental temperature conditions (30ºC or less) outside of the 
oxygen tank vessel walls. This encourages a portion of the water to condense and gather at the 

bottom of the tank from the influence of gravity, eliminating a separate water removal subsystem 

entirely. Maintaining the fuel cell stack and oxygen tank at an elevated temperature ensures that 

the oxygen gas remains saturated with steam, which enables the system to quickly transition 

between fuel cell and electrolysis modes if required and without damaging the fuel cell stack or 

requiring the high risk process of switching the reactant types through the tubing. 

Placing the unitized fuel cell stack inside of the oxygen tank greatly improves reliability and has 

some safety advantages described above, but also introduces some safety concerns that must be 

addressed in order to ensure successful implementation. Perhaps the most obvious concern is a 

leak of hydrogen out of the stack and into the oxygen vessel. A leak that is large enough to allow 

for hydrogen accumulation would result in the creation of a dangerous gas mixture that could 

start a fire or cause an explosion. A common and proven method of preventing the accumulation 

of a gas leaking into a vessel is the use of a getter to trap the gas or a catalyst to react the leaking 
gas with the ambient gas in the vessel. Teledyne has successfully used both methods in power 

system designs, including catalyst scavenging systems to control reactant leakage out of fuel cell 

systems inside of enclosures for underwater applications. The presence of the recirculation fan in 

the URFC system would greatly improve the effectiveness of catalyst scavenging by ensuring 

that any leaking gas reaches the catalyst surface. The catalyst would use a small amount of the 

oxygen present to convert the leaking hydrogen into water, which would condense and be 

collected at the bottom of the tank much like the product water from the fuel cell reaction. 

Mitigating hydrogen leakage by reacting it into water ensures that the reactant is not permanently 

lost to the system. The condensed water would be evaporated and split into hydrogen and oxygen 

during the next electrolysis cycle. Minimizing the number and size of hydrogen penetrations and 

30 

 
 
using welded connections is also important to help minimize hydrogen leakage into the vessel 

from the reactant tubing. 

The presence of the unitized stack within the oxygen vessel can run the risk of an electrical short. 

If the stack becomes submerged or covered in liquid water, the water can create a conductive 

path that allows current to bypass the cells within the stack. This effectively eliminates the power 

source in fuel cell mode and ceases gas generation in electrolysis mode. The stack must be 

mounted in an elevated position in the tank with respect to gravity to ensure that it cannot be 

submerged. The maximum liquid water volume present in the tank at any time is 12% of the tank 

volume, making the prospect of avoiding submerging the stack achievable within the vessel. If 

this cannot be guaranteed for all of the potential maneuvers performed by the aircraft, a separate 

but adjoining vessel can be mounted to the bottom of the oxygen vessel and designed in such a 

way to achieve all of the functions described above while preventing splashing and sloshing 

during flight. Section 3.4.2 will discuss this possibility in more detail. The liquid level 

monitoring device (DPT1) provides further protection against an overaccumulation of liquid 

water. A high level of greater than 10” will activate the water heater (HT2) to evaporate water 

back into steam. Coating the stack with a water resistant and electrically insulating material 

provides an additional layer of protection against this hazard. 

3.4.2  Water sloshing, oxygen tank 

Using the oxygen tank as the location for product water storage simplifies controls and 

eliminates extra components. With these benefits do come added concerns in a mobile 

application. Liquid in a tank that is partially filled is subject to the accelerations and changes in 

direction of the aircraft on which the tank is installed. The liquid has a free surface inside of the 

tank, which allows the forces exerted by the walls of the tank on the liquid via aircraft change in 

direction to generate waves within the liquid. These waves can violently disturb the liquid and 
create uncontrollable forces reverberating through the tank. Sloshing is commonly seen in 

propellant tanks for space applications and liquid cargo in tankers transported by truck, train, or 

ship. If unmitigated, these forces can damage the fuel cell stack or the tank and interfere with the 

controllability of the aircraft in flight. 

The risk of sloshing can be mitigated by installing baffles in the tank. Baffles are internal 

structures within the tank that break up the waves generated by sloshing forces while still 

allowing for communication of liquid between the sections partitioned off by the baffles. They 

are commonly employed in aircraft fuel tanks and in the other applications mentioned above 

where sloshing is observed. An example of a baffle design for a vertically mounted propellant 

tank is shown below in Figure 8. If baffles alone do not ensure that sloshing cannot present a

3.4.3  Discrete operation vs fast mode switching 

The URFC system design presented in this study provides the ability to alternate between fuel 

cell and electrolysis modes in short time spans, which can be of great advantage to an RFC 

system. The URFC system can be used as a load-leveling device, consuming excess power when 

available to generate gas and using that gas to provide additional power to devices or the aircraft. 

For the electric propulsion application, the device operates more like a discrete RFC system, with 

fuel cell mode employed during flight and electrolysis mode only used to refuel the aircraft when 

32 

 
 
 
 
on the ground. The discrete operation configuration is considered more gentle on the stack in 

terms of operation. The catalysts and electrodes of the cells would be subject to less degradation, 

increasing the lifetime of the system. The open cathode design of the URFC lends itself well to 

quick transitions from power production to electrolysis. However, the balance of plant 

equipment, specifically the valves and pumps required to manage the hydrogen reactant, may 

have trouble quickly shuttling between each mode if called upon to do so, but would have no 

issue with the slower transition between modes for the electric propulsion application. A system 

with this design may be more suitable to the electric propulsion application over the load-

balancing application for the reasons mentioned above. 

3.5  Applicability to other aircraft applications 

The system design for the electric propulsion application can also serve as the basis for a 787 

Dreamliner load-balancing application. The reactant storage capacity would be reduced because 

the system does not need to operate at full power for the duration of the flight and would even be 

replenishing reactant during certain flight stages by electrolysis. The reactant storage volumes 

would be sized proportionally to allow for equal pressurization and depressurization rates during 

both electrolysis and power consumption without the need for active control. This allows for a 

major simplification of the pressure and flow control by eliminating P1, SV1, SV2, V3, CV3, 

CV4, CV5, and FPR1. Control logic will be simpler, and the parasitic power observed will be 

reduced, making this system design promising for the application. Power electronics would need 

to handle quick alternations between fuel cell and electrolysis mode, although that is outside of 

the scope of this study. 

4  Mission simulation 

4.1 

Introduction 

Teledyne has developed a detailed model to simulate the mission profile of an electric propulsion 

aircraft using a 125 kW HTPEM URFC system. The model investigates the overall system 

performance during one, two, and five-hour flight missions as the electric propulsion aircraft 

goes through multiple power stages. A model simulating reactant regeneration was developed 

utilizing on-board and ground resources for the operation. The following sections detail the 

performance and parametric analysis of the unitized regenerative fuel cell technology in both 

modes of operation. 

33 

 
 
4.2  Fuel cell mode 

The information detailed in the system design was used to model the overall performance of the 

system in the mission simulation. A power and equipment list (PEL) was compiled using 

component data sheets to determine power consumption of each component at each power level 

of the flight profile. Two additional models were developed to account for the power 

consumption of the hydrogen recirculation blower and thermal control system as a function of 

the load. The parasitic power for all system components in fuel cell mode is 1520 W at 25%, 

1950 W at 50%, 2370 W at 75%, and 2800 W at maximum power.  

The steady state performance of the fuel cell system at maximum power for a five-hour flight 

was used to determine reactant consumption for baseline sizing of the system. The MEA data 

from the Advent PBI-membrane MEA specifications was used to determine stack efficiency, 
stack voltage, and current density at each power level since it is the most mature HTPEM 

technology (Advent High Temperature Membrane Electrode Assemblies, 2019). The total 

current of the system was then calculated and used to determine hydrogen and oxygen 

consumption rates during each stage of the flight mission. Table 4 lists the values at each power 

segment.

Once the reactant consumption rates were determined, the flight mission was modeled using the 

power profile at each stage of the flight. The performance curves model the overall hydrogen 

consumption and power level over the duration of each flight mission. Two separate scenarios 

were modeled for each of the one, two, and five-hour flight durations. The first simulation 

models the flight profile that fulfills the required stages of take-off, climb-out, cruise, descent, 

and landing. The second simulation models the flight profile with additional stages for diversion 

and go-around instances. The second model accounts for the potential to require go-around and 

diversion phases following the cruise stage of each flight. All stages of the flight are fixed except 

for the cruise stage. The flight missions including additional stages for diversion and go-around 

instances are representative of the worst-case reactant consumption. A summary of the stages 

and their properties, shown in Table 5, was used to build the power profile for each mission and 

calculate the energy consumption. The performance graphs for each mission simulation are 
shown in Figure 9 through Figure 14.

The aircraft cruises for 20 minutes during the one-hour flight mission, consuming 2303 moles of 

hydrogen and 1151 moles of oxygen. When the flight mission is extended by 18 minutes for 

additional stages, the total consumption increases to 3195 moles of hydrogen and 1598 moles of 

oxygen. For the best-case model, there was an excess of 1648 moles of hydrogen and 767 moles 

of oxygen. The worst case had an excess of 755 moles of hydrogen and 320 moles of oxygen. 

During the two-hour flight mission, the aircraft cruises for 80 minutes consuming 5081 moles of 

hydrogen and 2541 moles of oxygen. When the model accounts for additional stages, the total 

consumption increases to 5925 moles of hydrogen and 2964 moles of oxygen. For the best-case 

model, there was an excess of 1989 moles of hydrogen and 1018 moles of oxygen. The worst 

case had an excess of 1145 moles of hydrogen and 596 moles of oxygen. 

For the five-hour flight mission, the aircraft cruises for 260 minutes consuming 13393 moles of 

hydrogen and 6698 moles of oxygen. When the model accounts for additional stages, the total 

consumption increases to 14250 moles of hydrogen and 7127 moles of oxygen. For the best-case 

model, there was an excess of 3672 moles of hydrogen and 3371 moles of oxygen. The worst 

case had an excess of 2814 moles of hydrogen and 2942 moles of oxygen. 

38 

 
 
 
 
4.3  Electrolysis mode 

The reactant regeneration process proceeds after the aircraft has completed the flight mission. 

The fuel cell stack is electrically disconnected from the propulsion system of the aircraft. The 

hydrogen recirculation loop is deactivated during electrolysis mode. The recirculation pump P2 

is deactivated and solenoid valve SV2 is fully closed to terminate hydrogen flow through the 

system. Similarly, solenoid valve SV1 is fully closed to isolate FPR1 to prevent differential 

pressure control between the hydrogen and oxygen tank.  

The unitized stack will transition into electrolysis mode once ground power is connected to the 

system. The thermal control system maintains operation utilizing a ground air blower for the heat 

exchanger. In addition to the major components used during fuel cell mode, the hydrogen 

compressor is operative during electrolysis mode, which increases the parasitic power to  
6263 W. Additionally, the water heating element HT2 is activated to vaporize condensed water 

from the oxygen exhaust and control elevated liquid levels in T2. These components will rely on 

ground power supply water to operate. 

Research studies on HTPEM electrolysis from the Technical University of Denmark were used 

to determine the expected current density and voltage at a 125-kW power level using the same 

stack sized for electric propulsion (Hansen, et al., 2012). That information was used to determine 

the total current, the hydrogen production rate of 0.858 mol/s, and oxygen production rate of 

0.429 mol/s. As the system operates at steady state, 1154 SLM of hydrogen and 576 SLM of 

oxygen are generated while 0.980 SLM of water is consumed. During electrolysis mode, 98 kW 

of heat are generated as reactants are produced. 

As various flight missions were modeled in Section 4.2, minimum and maximum reactant 

consumption was determined. Although power levels change during flight missions, 8.15 kg/hr 

of hydrogen and 64.5 kg/hr of oxygen are consumed at 125 kW, while 6.226 kg/hr of hydrogen 
and 49.4 kg/hr of oxygen are generated during electrolysis mode. During the basic 1-hour flight 

modeled in Figure 9, 4.64 kg of hydrogen and 36.9 kg of oxygen were consumed. It would take 

about 45 minutes to regenerate the reactants used during that mission. For the 1-hour flight with 

additional stages, 6.44 kg of hydrogen and 51.1 kg of oxygen were consumed. The reactant 

regeneration would take 62 minutes. The basic 2-hour flight mission uses 10.2 kg of hydrogen 

and 81.3 kg of oxygen, which would take 98 minutes to regenerate. Similarly, the extended 2-

hour flight would use 12.1 kg of hydrogen 94.9 kg of oxygen resulting in a 115-minute 

regeneration period. The standard 5-hour flight mission uses 27 kg of hydrogen and 214.3 kg of 

oxygen. It would take 260 minutes, about 4.25 hours to regenerate the reactants. The 5-hour 

flight with additional stages goes through 28.7 kg of hydrogen and 228.1 kg of oxygen, which 

39 

 
 
would take 277 minutes, or 4.5 hours to regenerate. There is potential to reduce these refueling 

times even further. The system can operate higher current densities in electrolysis mode by 

taking advantage of an excess cooling capacity of 96 kW available in the thermal control system, 

which could potentially reduce refueling times by approximately 50%. 

5  Conclusions 

Teledyne sought to develop and explore a URFC concept for aircraft applications in this study. 

We reviewed the history of unitized fuel cell system development and implementation. Both 

LTPEM and SOFC technologies have been explored in these applications, with single cell, short 

stack, and even some full-size hardware built and tested. We chose to pursue a HTPEM-based 

URFC design with the goal of marrying the benefits of handling gaseous water in SOFC with the 

more manageable heat load of a PEM technology. We developed a system design based on an 

open-cathode HTPEM fuel cell stack housed inside of the oxygen storage tank and selected 

components to support its operation. This approach simplifies flow controls, removes the need 

for complex water management systems, and minimizes volume but adds some operational and 

safety challenges that need to be addressed in a matured system. We built a system model in 

Excel using inputs from real HTPEM performance data and information derived from the 

datasheets of chosen components. The model was used to explore the feasibility of powering an 

electric propulsion aircraft for one to five-hour flights. The results showed that the system 

concept could perform well in this application and might have operational benefits but may be 

challenging to implement due to the mass and volume required for the system. 

5.1  System benefits 

The URFC system proposed in this study provides benefits for the intended application. Short, 

regional flights with small numbers of passengers (less than ten) may be well served by this 
system. The URFC does not require refueling structure by eliminating jet fuel and having the 

built-in ability to recharge the fuel tanks while on the ground through electrolysis mode. The 

URFC only needs a source of electrical power at 125 kW at the landing site, which could 

increase the number of potential destinations serviced by the aircraft. The need to install 

hydrogen infrastructure at the landing sites has been removed, a requirement that has limited 

PEM fuel cell system implementations into aircraft due to the capital equipment investment and 

zoning requirements to ensure reliable and safe hydrogen supplies. When operating in flight, the 

fuel cell stack has the ability to provide electric power for more aircraft devices beyond just the 

propulsion system, including personal devices of passengers and avionics, as long as they 

represent a small percentage (<10%) of the propulsive load. These features combined can 

40 

 
 
provide operational advantages over battery and primary fuel cell systems being considered for 

electric propulsion aircraft of this class. 

5.2  Obstacles and next steps 

Despite the benefits of using the proposed URFC, many obstacles to implementation remain. The 

URFC system as proposed is quite bulky and heavy at a minimum of 4150 L and 2338 kg for the 

one-hour and two-hour application and 6870 L and 2837 kg for the five-hour mission, greatly 

prohibiting implementation on small electric propulsion aircraft. This is almost entirely driven by 

the reactant storage tanks. This corresponds to a specific power of 42 to 60 W/kg, with the 

maximum occurring for the one-hour mission, and a specific energy of 57 to 164 Wh/kg, with 

the maximum occurring for the five-hour mission. These performance metrics are both less than 

the hundreds of W/kg and 200 Wh/kg or greater from lithium ion batteries. The size of the 

hydrogen and oxygen tanks (V1 and V2) required to house both the fuel cell stack and the 

quantity of gas required to support the flight duration at the 125-kW scale prohibits 

implementation into the aircraft body. The large flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen and cooling 

load required to sustain the fuel cell reaction at 125 kW requires large fans, pumps, and heat 

exchangers (P1, P2, P3, F2, HX1) with high parasitic power requirements, as well as many 

supporting components for alternating operational modes and providing layers of safety.  

The system as proposed might be better suited from a volumetric standpoint as an auxiliary 

power unit on a larger aircraft, such as the 787 Dreamliner application discussed earlier in this 

study. The magnitude of power delivered versus the overall power of the aircraft results in a fuel 

cell system volume that has the potential to fit within the available cargo space of the aircraft 

instead of taking up a large portion of the fuselage. The overall mass of the system may be of 

greater concern and would greatly impact the aerodynamics of the aircraft. A mass breakdown of 

the system components is shown in Figure 15. This system concept might demonstrate a better 
technical fit to applications at a power scale of two to three orders of magnitude lower, with 

power requirements of 1 kW or less. The size of the oxygen tank and fuel cell stack as well as 

the reactant flow and cooling required to support operation would be greatly reduced. There may 

be applicability to UAVs that fall within this class, although ambient air breathing fuel cell 

systems are sure to have better power density metrics. Applications could still be found for 

UAVs operating in areas without a source of clean ambient air, such as battlefields, disaster 

recovery, and other harsh environments. 

41 

 
 
 
Figure 15. System mass breakdown, 125-kW URFC 

Potential applications for smaller electric propulsion aircraft include air taxis, which make 

several short flights on demand. The URFC system proposed in this study could potentially 

service these applications. An impediment to successful operation of this system in an air taxi is 

the time it takes to recharge the reactant storage tanks by electrolysis. Electrolysis-based 

refueling does eliminate the need for hydrogen and oxygen infrastructure at the site at the 

expense of refueling time. Refueling by electrolysis is not as quick as filling the tank from a 

compressor and pressurized storage tanks. A refueling process in URFC system in this study that 

is on the order of 50-75% of the length of the flight could limit the functionality of an air taxi and 

other electric propulsion aircraft that require frequent trips with multiple stops. Increasing the 

power used for electrolysis would reduce the time to refuel but would put stress on the coolant 

system that is sized for the fuel cell load as well as other components required to maintain 

operation. 

42 

 
 
 
The URFC system proposed in this study employs novel system design concepts that promise 

operational benefits but may also have unforeseen circumstances. Integrating the system into 

aircraft applications will require multiple phases of development and demonstration to test the 

subsystems and prove the functionality and safety of the design. Performing FMEAs at each 

stage of development and completing testing on individual components and subsystems will help 

identify weaknesses in the system design, as well as the risks most likely to cause performance 

and safety issues. 

HTPEM technology resides in an optimal temperature range for a URFC application. Despite 

this system-level advantage, HTPEM performance in fuel cell mode shows a lower efficiency 

that that exhibited by LTPEM and SOFCs. Today’s LTPEM and SOFC technologies are built 

upon several decades of technology development through materials research, cell and stack 

design, manufacturing improvements, and expertise gained through system integration in real 

world applications. The relative novelty of HTPEM technologies and lack of widespread 

implementation in the market puts it at a disadvantage. There is a need for improvements in 

efficiency for fuel cell operation in order to reduce the mass and volume of the stack. Better data 

on steam-fed electrolysis, which has almost no published research, is also needed. Durability of 

HTPEM is a primary concern in each mode. The role of water in degrading the acid-impregnated 

high temperature membranes is well known and must be properly managed in this application. A 

unitized system of this design may not be the right approach today with this in mind. The 

technology maturity is too low for near-term implementation, but might be achievable given time 

and investment, especially if other potential applications of the technology can be found.
