16. Abstract 

The  safe  implementation  of  three  fuel  cell  power  system  (FCPS)  technologies  to  provide  auxiliary  power  for  commercial  air 
transport aircraft was evaluated. The first implementation is polymer electrolyte membrane FCPS for narrow-body, short to mid-
range  aircraft,  using  pressurized  hydrogen  gas  as  fuel.  The  second  implementation  uses  regenerative  fuel  cell  power  system 
(RFCPS)  for  the  same  type  of  aircraft.  The  third  implementation  uses  solid  oxide  (SO)  FCPS  for  wide-body,  long-range, 
intercontinental aircraft, converting liquid jet engine fuel through onboard fuel reformer. During the research, assumptions were 
made for these implementations to be practical and probable. The high-level notional concept design of each implementation is 
intended to expose new safety hazards associated with these new technologies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Honeywell  has  been  funded  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  to  study  the  safe 
implementation of aircraft fuel cell (FC) auxiliary power unit (APU) on commercial air transport 
aircraft and develop a Recommended Technical Standard Guideline (RTSG) to address aircraft 
safety hazards associated with such implementations. 

In  this  effort,  the  installation  and  operational  concepts  were  developed  for  three  diverse  FC 
technologies on notional commercial air transport platforms. The systems studied were: 

• 
• 
• 

Polymer electrolyte membrane systems  
Regenerative fuel cells 
Solid oxide fuel cell 

In  each  case,  a  technically  plausible  FC  application  was  conceived,  which,  at  least  minimally, 
assumed the role of a conventional jet fuel-powered gas turbine auxiliary power unit. Plausibility 
meant  that  the  FC  system  installation  was  comparable  in  weight  and  accommodated  the 
critical/emergency functionality of the APU role. Weight parity was achieved on a system level 
with conventional systems through a higher integration with the aircraft non-APU systems. Many 
non-critical  APU functions and services were compromised or deleted. The hazards of service, 
maintenance,  and  operation  were  assessed  for  each  system  in  the  context  of  these  notional 
installations. The RTSG includes these hazards and is separately published and appended to this 
report. Due to time and scope constraints, note that none of these FC systems/installation concepts 
were optimized. 

The study provides the following conclusions: 

• 

• 

• 

The implementation of any of the FC technologies in the role of an APU is  impractical 
without making significant changes in the aircraft energy architecture to offset the lower 
power density of the fuel cell auxiliary power system (FCAPS) and the lack of pneumatic 
bleed capability in  the FCAPS. A  more electric  architecture  (MEA) will be optimal for 
FCAPS applications.  
PEM  fuel  cell  power  systems  will  require  a  significant  change  in  airport  energy 
infrastructure,  with  the  requirement  for  high-pressure,  gaseous  hydrogen  refueling 
services. 
Solid  oxide  fuel  cell  power  systems  will  require  sulfur-free  or  ultra-low  sulfur  content, 
aviation-fuel refueling services. 

Based on the findings, the RTSG incorporates the following elements: 

•  High-pressure hydrogen gas storage, regulation, and control 
•  High-pressure hydrogen storage vessel mounting vulnerability 
•  Hydrogen transmission through/near flammable and combustible materials 
•  Active combustible gas monitoring and ventilation 
•  Flammable materials in oxygen-rich environment 
•  FC reactant mixture in oxygen-enriched environment 
•  FC reactant system cleanliness 

xiv 

 
•  Two-phase fuel handling in fuel reformer 
•  Steam system integrity and safety 
•  Draining, ventilating, and energy channeling 

The RTSG reflects these findings in the minimum performance standard.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The aviation industry has been studying, performing tests and developing prototypes to support 
several applications of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMFC) and 
regenerative fuel cells (RFC) on airplanes. Honeywell performed the Aircraft Fuel Cell and Safety 
Management System study funded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under contract 
DTFACT-16-C-00037. To conduct this study, Honeywell leveraged its significant experience in 
the  research,  development,  and  production  of  military,  commercial,  and  general  aviation 
pneumatic,  electrical,  and  mechanical  systems,  including  APUs  in  the  aviation  industry.  The 
findings in this report do not represent Honeywell’s position on aircraft fuel cell power system as 
APU. 

1.1  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 

The purpose of this program is to study and develop FC technology for safe and certifiable aircraft 
installations. This research also develops data and recommendations for FAA and global partners 
to support appropriate standards, regulations, and means of demonstrating safe compliance. 

This effort develops installation and operational  concepts for three diverse  FC technologies for 
notional commercial air transport platforms.  

• 

• 

• 

Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) systems — Draw oxygenated air from the ambient 
or pressurized cabin environments, using stored/replenished pressurized gaseous hydrogen. 
Regenerative FCs — Contain high-pressure hydrogen gas and high-pressure oxygen gas in 
a  hermetic  system.  In  a  closed  system,  they  generate  electrical  power  by  reacting  the 
captive  hydrogen  and  oxygen  in  a  PEM  stack,  producing  captive  water;  and  then 
hydrolyzing  the  water  in  a  reverse  reaction  back  into  hydrogen  and  oxygen  gas  on  the 
ground between flights, or in flight using excess electrical energy on the aircraft. 
SOFC — Uses recovered water onboard to reform ultra-low sulfur jet fuel from the fuel 
tanks  on  board  the  aircraft  into  hydrogen,  and  carbon  monoxide,  and  then  reacts  the 
hydrogen with ambient or cabin air oxygen in a high-temperature ceramic fuel cell stack 
to produce electric power for the aircraft.  

The specific objective of this work is to develop a Recommended Technical Standard Guidelines 
(RTSG)  document  that  serves  to  complement  the  FAA  energy  storage  device  (ESD)  aviation 
rulemaking committee objective, in  support of  regulatory agency  certification requirements  for 
fuel cell power systems (FCPS) installed on commercial aircraft for auxiliary power.  

1.2  GENERAL APPROACH 

1.2.1  Create RTSG Framework 

The initial step is to create a framework for the RTSG, based on Technical Standard Order (TSO) 
C77b, for certifying APUs  on commercial air transport aircraft. The findings of  safety  impacts 
related to the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the FCPS implementation were 
captured from the notional concept design (NCD) and consolidated and documented during the 
course of this effort, which is the deliverable at the conclusion of this study. 

1 

 
1.2.2  Assess Plausible FCPS Implementation Architecture 

This study focuses on three representative FC system architectures featuring various technologies: 

• 
• 
• 

PEM fuel cell power system (PEMFCPS) using pressurized hydrogen gas stored on board 
Regenerative FC closed system 
Solid oxide fuel cell power system (SOFCPS) using hydrogen and carbon monoxide- 
enriched gas from onboard jet fuel reformation technology 

The technology for the PEM fuel cells is mature in the automotive industry. While several major 
automobile  manufacturers  have  developed  hydrogen-fueled  vehicles  with  PEM/electric  drive, 
production has been limited. Most operate in the western states, where hydrogen refueling stations 
have been built and located in major metropolitan areas. This same technology has been suggested 
for application on commercial aircraft. GM recently partnered with Liebherr-Aerospace to develop 
hydrogen-fueled  FCs  for  aircraft  auxiliary-power  applications,  providing  power  for  aircraft 
lighting,  air-conditioning,  backup  systems,  and  other  auxiliary  functions.  (Wayland,  Michael, 
“How  aerospace  could  be  a  key  to  GM’s  future  in  fuel  cells,”  Automotive  News/Crain 
Communications, 
June  18,  2018,  https://www.autonews.com/article/20180618/OEM06/ 
180619766/how-aerospace-could-be-a-key-to-gm-s-future-in-fuel-cells.) 

Regenerative  FCs  are  essentially  a  bi-directional  fuel  cell  that  operates  in  a  closed  system.  It 
catalyzes gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, both captive in the system, into water, simultaneously 
producing electric power. It recharges when external electrical power is applied to the fuel cell, 
hydrolyzing the captive water back into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen. NASA initially developed 
this  system  for  low-orbit  satellites,  and  later,  a  unitized  regenerative  PEM  fuel  cell  for  high-
altitude, solar-powered research aircraft (Helios), though it was not used. A regenerative system 
that  uses  excess  electrical  power  from  Main  Engine  (ME)  generators  (or  ground  power)  to 
electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen has been suggested for application on commercial air 
transport aircraft to assist in the auxiliary-power generation. 

1.2.2.1  SOFCPS with Hydrogen Enriched Gas from Onboard Jet Fuel Reformation 

SOFCPS technology  was developed in  the  late 1990s and early 2000s with  significant  funding 
through  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  for  use  in  various  stationary  and  automotive 
applications. Ceres Power, Bloom Energy, and others have been developing products in this area 
for  stationary  and  marine  applications.  As  applied  to  aerospace  for  auxiliary  power,  this 
technology/architecture would use an onboard jet fuel reformation system to process jet fuel into 
hydrogen-enriched gas for the fuel cell. Waste heat from the process is also available for aircraft 
use,  such  as  cargo  compartment  or  battery  heating.  Because  these  systems  require  elevated 
temperatures for optimal operation, and because system startup takes a comparatively long time, 
frequent starts may be impractical, as is characteristic of current aircraft power demand profiles. 
An optimal SOFCPS requires continuous operation. 

The  operation  of  a  full-time  APU  alleviates  the  relatively  long  start-up  time  and  transfers 
secondary power demand from the MEs at an equivalent or higher efficiency, enabling the use of 
advanced high-performance engine configurations. 

2 

 
1.2.3  Assumptions 

The traditional gas turbine (GT) APU assumes the role of extending all functions of the ME besides 
the propulsive power, when the MEs are off or compromised. This includes providing full electric- 
power capability and compressed air “bleed” for pneumatic power. The GT APU is a miniaturized 
internal combustion engine that shares the same power generation principle and construction, uses 
the same fuel, and services the same power system architecture as the MEs. The mimicking and 
sharing between the APU and ME allow for a most compact and elegant APU package. The current 
state-of-the-art (SOA) GT APU provides integrated shaft to power the load compressor, and geared 
drive to power electric generator(s), at an impressive specific power in excess of 3 kW/kg, while 
the DOE’s ultimate goal for integrated transportation fuel cell power systems of 0.65kW/kg. 

Direct  drop-in  GT  APU  replacement  with  FCPS  is  not  feasible.  To  accept  FCPS  as  a  viable 
replacement,  modifications  have  to  occur  from  aircraft  systems  level  up  to  fleet  concept  of 
operation. Therefore, the following reasonable technologically grounded assumptions are made: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

These  FC  technologies  are  at  various  states  of  maturity.  Reasonable  and  optimistic 
assumptions  are  based  on  the  advancement  of  these  FC  technologies  for  aircraft 
implementation. 
To be feasible, the FCPS implementation requires significant modifications to the aircraft 
power system architecture. The modifications range from a refresh of the existing platform 
to a clean-sheet design of a brand-new aircraft. 
Different  infrastructures  are  needed  for  different  FCPS  technology,  from  gate  power  to 
hydrogen refilling, to pre-treatment of liquid aviation fuel. 
Each FCPS favors its own and different concept of operation, from minimal use to all-time 
operation. 
The  operational  characteristics  of  each  FCPS  need  to  match  the  characteristics  of  the 
market segments and platforms.  

1.3  NEAR-TERM IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS 

Before  developing  the  notional  concept  design  for  each  FCPS  technology,  a  high-level, 
preliminary  design  exercise  was  performed  to  help  narrow  down  the  possibilities  and  to  avoid 
creating a more detailed concept design and safety assessment around an FCPS implementation 
that was not credible. This effort considered each system’s high-level attributes and attempted to 
match them up with aircraft power system architectures, identifying potential synergies, and gaps, 
and generating a preliminary weight and fuel consumption assessments. 

1.4  CREATE  NOTIONAL  CONCEPT  DESIGN  FOR  EACH  FCPS  TECHNOLOGY 
IMPLEMENTATION 

The  notional  concept  design  (NCD)  of  each  FCPS  is  created  to  expose  new  safety  hazards 
introduced  by  the  new  technologies.  The  NCD  approach  is  qualitative  design  supported  by 
quantitative requirements, which also considered multiple design options. 

The output of the NCD is neither a specific system design nor a suggestive trade study.

1.5  METHODOLOGIES 

The nature of this study is geared toward the future.  It is high-level speculative work aimed to 
expose potential new safety hazards associated with the most unlikely implementation examples. 
Industry  norm  or  projected  values  from  “Fuel  Cell  Technologies  Office  Multi  Year  Research 
Development Demonstration Plan” are used where appropriate. 

A  multitude  of  engineering  modeling  tools  was  used  to  support  the  definition  of  FCPS 
implementation requirement, including these physics-based models: 

•  RDS — Off-the-shelf aircraft performance model for engine thrust requirement  
•  FAST — In-house proprietary engine performance model for engine fuel burn requirement 
•  Excel — Various customized spreadsheet models for FCPS performance and iteration 

between aircraft and engine model input/outputs 

When  information  was  not  readily  available,  qualitative  analogous  technique  and  engineering 
judgment were used. 

2.  NEAR-TERM IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS 

2.1  BACKGROUND 

The  modern  Air  Transport  APU  assumes  the  role  of  extending  all  ME  non-propulsive 
functionalities, when the MEs are off or compromised. The typical APU today is a relatively small 
gas turbine that shares the same power generation principle and construction, uses the same fuel, 
and services the same power system architecture as the ME. These similarities between the APU 
and ME allow for a most compact and elegant APU package. The current state-of-the-art (SOA) 
GT APU provides an integrated shaft to drive the load compressor for pneumatic power, and a 
reduction gearbox to drive electric generator(s) and other accessories, at a specific power in excess 
of 3 kW/kg. Except for extended twin-engine aircraft operations (ETOPS), the GT APU operates 
mostly on the ground. The fuel consumed before the flight reduces the aircraft weight, and the fuel 
consumed after the flight comes from the required flight reserve.  Therefore, there is no weight 
penalty for fuel consumed by the APU. 

By comparison, DOE’s “Integrated Transportation Fuel Cell Power Systems Operating on Direct 
Hydrogen” ultimately targets on specific power to 0.65kW/kg, not including hydrogen storage, 
power electronics, and electric drive, according to the Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year 
Research  Development  Demonstration  Plan.  The  ultimate  target  specific  power  for  “Fuel  Cell 
Auxiliary Power Units” is an order of magnitude lower at 0.045 kW/kg albeit at  a much lower 
power range of 1 to 10 kWe. As a result, for the same power requirement, the fuel cell systems 
weigh significantly more than a GT system.  

As hydrogen for a PEMFCPS or RFCPS is required exclusively for the FC operation, dedicated 
onboard storage is needed. The gravimetric efficiency of hydrogen fuel storage is near 7%, so the 
heavy tanks used for fuel storage are always required.

2.2  APPROACH 

2.2.1  Assumptions 

The current reality is that none of the fuel cell power systems evaluated in this study can provide 
the same aircraft auxiliary functionality as the conventional gas turbine powered APU does within 
the  constraints  of  the  prevailing  pneumatic  mechanical-system  aircraft  architecture  and 
transportation system energy infrastructure. However, to make a meaningful safety assessment, 
the FCPS design and configuration must be reasonably capable of delivering the minimum basic 
services required of the future aircraft. At the same time, it must provide these services within, or 
be reasonably comparable, to the weight and volume constraints of current aircraft systems. This 
means that for each FCPS evaluated, optimistic assumptions are made that might enable this new 
technology, even to the point of adding functionality with a corresponding benefit unique to the 
FCPS, that may not currently exist on commercial air transport aircraft.  

The FCPS implementations are assessed based on 2020 target performance factors published by 
the  DOE  Fuel  Cell  Technologies  Office  Multi-Year  Research,  Development,  and 
Demonstration Plan. (US Department of Energy/Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy, April 2013, DOE Fuel Cell Technologies Office Multi-Year Research, Development, 
and  Demonstration  Plan, 
https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/downloads/fuel-cell- 
technologies-office-multi-year-research-development-and-22) . 

Future  aircraft  system  architectures  are  based  on  various  industry  published  reports  and  prior 
Honeywell internal studies. This analysis uses values and factors from these studies for electrical 
power demand, system weight impact, and an overall fuel burn assessment. 

These assumptions apply to the following areas: 

Market Segment: Each FCPS technology may have unique characteristics that are better suited 
to  a  specific  air  transport  market  segment.  Each  assessment  identifies  these  market  segments, 
including aircraft platform class, relevant flight routing, and operating procedures. 

Infrastructure:  Required  airport  infrastructure  will  be  available,  including  gate  power  and 
services, high-pressure hydrogen gas refueling services, and/or the availability of sulfur-free jet 
fuel. 

Concept  of  Operation:  The  concept  of  operation  of  the  aircraft  with  a  FCPS  is  changed  to 
accommodate  the  specific  characteristics  and  operational  requirements  of  the  FCPS.  While  the 
aircraft’s functional requirements are still met, depending on the system being evaluated, ground 
operations  may  require  increased  dependency  on  terminal  services,  and/or  additional  synergies 
between the FCPS and adjacent aircraft systems and services assumed to meet these requirements. 
ETOPS is also a consideration in some FCPS implementations. 

Aircraft Power System: New system architectures, and smart load management will be key to a 
successful FCPS implementation. Since the FCPS produces direct current (DC) electrical power, 
architectures will be assumed, which are biased towards using electrical power for services that 
previously used pneumatic power, such as the ME starting function and the cabin environmental 
(temperature) control.  

5 

 
 
2.2.2  Assessment 

The approach to define characteristics necessary for implementation are: (1) practical power draw 
from the aircraft for feasible sizing; (2) system weight; and (3) potential fuel-burn savings, if any. 
The shape and volume of the system will be highly dependent on the level of system integration 
and will be addressed later in each individual FCPS assessment. 

Conventional APUs are sized for the maximum power within the operating envelope. This peak 
load  may  only  occur  for  short  periods  of  demand,  such  as  during  main  engine  start  (MES)  or 
emergency electric power at  altitude. Because  all FCPSes have  a relatively low specific power 
compared  to  a  GT  APU,  an  alternative  approach  will  be  used,  which  assumes  that  a  more 
sophisticated power management system utilizes the FCPS over a level power demand profile and 
uses the ESDs such as batteries to supplement the peak power demand and assist transient states. 
The average power demand will be used for the FCPS size calculation. 

To determine plausibility, a base, or critical level of functionality must be met, along with weight 
parity.  A  rough  concept  for  the  system  footprint  also  will  be  created.  The  weight  differential 
between a GT APU and a FCPS will be projected using published APU data and DOE factors. 
This  weight  comparison  considers  a  conventional  GT  APU  on  an  aircraft  with  a  conventional 
pneumatic bleed architecture and compares it with  a more electric aircraft (MEA) architecture. 
Weight  differentials  of  affected  systems  will  be  assessed  based  on  values  from  industry 
publications and proprietary Honeywell internal studies. Various aircraft and engine performance 
models are used to project fuel burn. 

2.3  POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS 

Current  aircraft  GT  APUs  have  very  high  gravitational  specific  power  and  volumetric  power 
density. As noted earlier, FCPS APU cannot compete in a like-for-like  aircraft implementation 
based on size, weight, and power (SWaP), and fuel burn. 

Many other factors weigh into decisions to adopt FC technology for GT APU replacement that are 
beyond the scope of this analysis, such as emissions, noise, regulations and mandate, costs, start-
up time, reliability, life, etc. 

Weight  is  a  primary  factor  for  system  implementation  possibilities,  with  respect  to  assessment 
uncertainty. No hard pass/fail criteria are used to determine the likelihood of FCPS technology 
implementation. Rather, the best effort projection of FCPS and associated aircraft changes are used 
for assessing the most likely implementation for certification safety issues and concerns. 

2.3.1  Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell Power System 

The key factors of successfully implementing a PEMFCPS are to minimize its size and weight. 
The  key  parameters  affecting  size  and  weight  are  the  power  (FC  stack  size)  and  energy  (fuel 
quantity/storage size). High-power demand functions need to be satisfied by other means (such as 
ME generators or ground power) and hydrogen fuel use needs to be minimized by using this system 
only in necessary instances or if it enables higher benefit from other systems. 

6 

 
2.3.1.1  Target Market Segment 

The  obvious  target  market  segment  for  PEMFCPS  is  commercial  air  transport,  narrow-body 
aircraft,  of  Boeing  737  and  Airbus  A320  class,  operating  domestically  for  short  to  mid-range 
flights, without ETOPS certification. Advancement of PEMFCPS technology for the automotive 
industry makes it the most mature FCPS with power ranges potentially suitable for this aircraft 
application/implementation.  The  large  production  quantities  of  this  aircraft  class  make  it  an 
attractive market sector encouraging manufacturer investment. 

In  this  initial  assessment,  ETOPS  certification  would  significantly  increase  the  size  of  the 
PEMFCPS, potentially making it infeasible. However, there are sufficient domestic routes that do 
not require ETOPS certification to potentially justify the PEMFCPS. 

These  aircrafts  assume  the  following:  be  equipped  with  internal  hydrogen  storage  to  support 
PEMFCPS operation; the air for the PEMFCPS will be fed from the cabin air outflow valve; the 
aircraft to employ a more electric power architecture, with an electric starter-generator mounted 
on  each  engine;  the  main  engines  to  provide  bleed  air  for  cabin  pressurization;  and  the  cabin 
environmental  control  system  to  use  an  electric-driven  vapor  cycle  system  to  manage  the 
temperature of the bleed air pressuring the cabin. 

2.3.1.2  Concept of Operations 

United Airlines announced back in March of 2015 that it was going to change its procedures on 
APU operation, and cease starting the APU after landing. (Sumers, Brian, March 16, 2015, “United 
to change APU procedures after successful Denver test,” https://atwonline.com/avionics/united-
change-apu-procedures-after-successful-denver-test.) More recently, United also announced that 
it would use terminal services whenever available and further limit/reduce the usage of aircraft 
APUs. These moves by United suggest a concept of operations (CONOPS) where APU services 
are only routinely used for ME starting. Extending this CONOPS to the future state, a PEMFCPS 
similarly might also be used only on the ground for ME start, during the transition between gate 
(ground) power and ME power (a necessity).  

In addition, it is anticipated that these future aircrafts with MEs that use an advanced high-pressure 
ratio engine core may need the PEMCPS to provide electrical power during descent, so that the 
MEs can be pulled back to flight idle. This ability enables ME operability improvement and related 
fuel-burn reduction. Here is a summary of the preliminary CONOPS:

currently operated today.

2.3.1.4  Potential System Description 

The PEMFCPS was initially envisioned with dual-stack arrangement, co-located or integrated with 
the ECS for close coupling of the electric power and purge air from ECS. The FCPS cathode is fed 
by boosted cabin air; the stack is water cooled, and the final heat sink is ambient (ram) air.

2.3.1.4.1  Hydrogen Fuel  

The required hydrogen fuel, and the fuel storage size, is calculated based on the assumed load, 
operating time, and DOE target FC efficiencies and weight factors (see Table 2).

The total hydrogen required per flight is 5.6 kg, without margin and reserve for runway delay use, 
because the MEs could provide power during flight descent if necessary. 

2.3.1.4.2  Weight 

The overall weight estimates are based on data derived from the public domain (GT APU, FCPS, 
hydrogen fuel system, etc.), prior Honeywell proprietary internal studies (MES and ECS, weight 
fuel-burn penalty, etc.), and Honeywell proprietary engine models (FID fuel saving potential) (see 
Table 3). In this assessment, the PEMFCPS in a more electric architecture (MEA) with electric 
MES and electric-driven VCS/ECS is compared with a conventional GT powered system using 
pneumatic AC/ECS and MES. In the table below, the FCPS benefits from being sized to an average 
power requirement, which is much smaller than the conventional GT APU, and from the much 
smaller  ducting  required  to  feed  and  exhaust  the  PEMFCPS.  The  value  reflected  in  Aircraft 
Systems reflects the adjusted results of a previously unpublished Honeywell study, which traded 
the benefits of a MEA vs pneumatic bleed aircraft architecture. These adjustments accounted for 
PEMFCPS-specific requirements that were not in the original study.

Note that the PEMFCPS can provide emergency power but did not take weight credit of the ram 
air turbine (RAT) because some narrow-body air transport aircrafts, such as Boeing 737, are not 
equipped with one. 

2.3.1.4.3  Fuel Burn 

The impact of the PEMFCPS on jet fuel burn or aircraft fuel consumption was assessed, together 
with the PEMFCPS dedicated hydrogen fuel requirement. As noted in Table 3, the lower weight 
of the PEMFCPS resulted in a net decrease in jet fuel burned during flight.  

MEs are very efficient in providing electric (shaft) power during climb, and particularly cruise, 
due to its high derivative efficiency adjacent its power setting. But when idling, the electric (shaft) 
power demands a speed higher than necessary due to operability consideration, thereby producing 
excess thrust, and corresponding high fuel burn. Thus, when the APU or PEMCPS can provide 
this electric power, the MEs can pull back to idle during descent, resulting in fuel savings. 

Table 4 compares the overall fuel burn difference between GT APU and FCPS-equipped aircraft 
for reference only.

2.3.1.5  Preliminary Assessment 

The  preliminary  conclusion  is  that  the  PEMFCPS  could  be  a  technically  plausible  solution  for 
secondary or auxiliary power in the midsize narrow-body commercial air transport segment. In 
this assessment, the system appears to have comparable weight as conventional systems. It brings 
the additional benefit of producing none of the exhaust emissions, including CO, CO2, NOx or 
non-volatile particulates of either environmental or health concerns. This system also is inherently 
quiet, to the benefit of passengers, ramp workers, and airport neighborhoods. The system weight 
will certainly change and likely to increase as development progresses. However, it is not expected 
to increase beyond the plausible limit. 

11 

 
 
 
 
This finding, of course, is contingent on several basic assumptions, which may or may not come 
to pass. Key among these assumptions are: 

• 
• 

• 

• 

The implementation of an MEA in future aircraft. 
The  implementation  of  a  hydrogen  infrastructure  at  airports  to  support  refueling  of  the 
aircraft secondary/auxiliary power systems. 
The  willingness  of  air  carriers  to  forgo  terminal  independence,  to  require  that  airport 
terminals  provide  both  cabin  air  ventilation  and  temperature  control,  as  well  as  electric 
power. Given that these aircraft will have an efficient ECS, electric power for the VCS/ECS 
could be a substitute for conditioned air from the terminal. 
These aircraft are not required to operate with ETOPS. 

Extended  operation  of  the  PEMFCPS  will  affect  the  on-board  hydrogen  fuel  system  size  and 
weight. The system used in this plausibility assessment operates only for 47 minutes per flight. 
System/value trades could dedicate more storage weight for additional PEMFCPS operating time, 
enabling ETOPS or time-limited terminal independence. Technology improvements in hydrogen 
storage gravitational efficiency would benefit the system with longer durations.  

2.3.2  Regenerative Fuel Cell Power System (RFCPS) 

Regenerative fuel cells are a relatively recent technology. In concept, they are a reversible fuel 
cell,  with  integrated  gaseous  reactants.  Functionally,  they  use  external  electrical  power  to 
internally electrolyze pure water (H2O) into separate internal reservoirs of gaseous hydrogen and 
oxygen gas and are then capable of providing electrical power by catalyzing the H2 and O2 back 
to water. The size of the PEM stack defines/limits the  voltage of the unit. The flow rate of the 
reactants  defines  the  current.  The  capacity  of  the  integrated  gaseous  reactants  defines  the  total 
energy  storage  capacity.  While  the  concept  of  a  reversible  fuel  cell  goes  back  to  the  1960s, 
significant  development  occurred  in  the  1990s  and  early  2000s.  NASA  prototyped  the 
development  of  a  fuel  cell,  integrating  a  PEM  stack,  electrolyzer,  balance  of  plant,  and  high-
pressure storage for reactants with the vision of using the device on a high-altitude, solar-powered 
research aircraft (Helios). Various government funded and commercial development efforts have 
further refined the technology, making it more compact and affordable. There appears to be active 
efforts to  market  this technology  for stationary, temporary energy storage, as well as for space 
applications. 

The  attraction  of  the  RFCPS  for  air  transport  aviation  is  that  it  does  not  require  any  hydrogen 
infrastructure. Unlike the PEMFCPS, there is no need to refuel this system unless a maintenance 
action.  

2.3.2.1  Target Market Segment 

Like  the  PEMFCPS,  the  RFCPS  may  be  best  suited  for  commercial  air  transport  narrow-body 
aircraft, of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 class, operating domestically for short to mid-range 
flights, without ETOPS certification. While this technology is less developed than the PEMFCPS, 
there  is  no  infrastructure  change  that  is  required  for  its  implementation.  The  large  production 
quantities  of  this  aircraft  class  make  it  an  attractive  market  sector,  encouraging  manufacturer 
investment. 

12 

 
In  this  initial  assessment,  ETOPS  certification  would  significantly  increase  the  system  size, 
potentially making it infeasible. However, there are sufficient domestic routes that do not require 
ETOPS certification to potentially justify the RFCPS. 

It is assumed that these aircrafts employ a more electric power architecture, with an electric-starter 
generator mounted on each engine, with MEs that provide bleed air for cabin pressurization, and 
a cabin environmental control system that uses an electric driven, vapor-cycle system to manage 
the temperature of the bleed air pressuring the cabin. 

2.3.2.2  Concept of Operation 

Because the RFCPS can provide continuous power for a duration limited by its reactant capacity, 
like the PEMFCPS, a similar concept of operation will be followed. The difference for the RFCPS 
is that during the period following RFCPS operation, when not providing power, the RFCPS is in 
regenerative  mode  converting  water  back  into  high  pressure  hydrogen  and  oxygen  gases  using 
electric power from the MEs. For the RFCPS, the concept of operation is :

The RFCPS power starts the first ME. 
The first ME starts the second ME. 
The RFCPS switches to regenerative mode after both engines are operating. 
The MEs power the aircraft and the RFCPS electrolyzer through taxi, takeoff, climb, and 
cruise phases of the flight as currently operated today. 
The RFPS switches to power-generation mode at the top of descent and provides all electric 
power during the descent phase of the flight. 
During  approach,  the  MEs  resume  supply  of  electric  power,  and  the  RFCPS  will  be 
switches to regenerative mode.

2.3.2.4  Potential RFCPS System Description 

The RFCPS can be discrete (separate stacks for water electrolyzer and FC) or unitized (common 
stack).  

The unitized stack is attractive due to its simplicity. Figure 3 shows a basic concept for the unitized 
regenerative fuel cell power system (URFCPS). It features a single unitized stack that performs 
both  electrolysis  and  power-generation  process.  In  its  simplest  form,  no  operational  pressure 
regulation  or  flow  control  is  necessary.  However,  URFCPS  technology  is  still  in  early 
development, and may see significant changes as performance, durability, cost, and safety issues 
are identified and resolved ahead of successful commercialization.  

Currently, the URFCPS lacks the flexibility to tailor the electrolyzer and FC stack functions to the 
system duty cycle. Because the FC and electrolyzer operate under different conditions, substantial 
compromises must be made in the design of URFCPS, which may make it less competitive than 
other options. Most importantly, the potential hazard of inability to isolate reactants from failure 
mode such as  autoignition in  the stack will result in catastrophic consequence due to  the high-
pressure, high-energy reactants stored in close proximity. The overall assessment makes URFCPS 
for commercial aircraft implementation implausible, and, therefore, no further action is considered.

Depending on the electrolysis pressure, as its power density is higher than that of the PEMFCPS, 
the system may consist of multiple smaller units. Since the RFCPS does not rely on air for oxygen 
source, it opens many more installation options. And because it’s a closed system, maintenance is 
minimized. A distributed power network could be realized with this technology.

Because the gaseous hydrogen fuel storage system (FSS) consumes the most energy of the three 
operating conditions (listed in Table 5), it is sized for the FID energy requirement, and because 
any fuel consumed during MES or ground operation prior to takeoff can be regenerated by MEs 
during the subsequent flight. MEs can generate fuel required for ground and MES during taxi or 
at the terminal from ground power. This allows the size of the RFCPS fuel system to be reduced 
from the 5.6 kg required for the PEMFCPS to 2.3 kg. Since a stoichiometric amount of oxygen is 
also required, an additional 18.4 kg of oxygen is necessary.

2.3.2.4.3  Weight 

The overall weight estimates are based on data derived from the public domain (GT APU, FCPS, 
hydrogen fuel system, etc.), prior Honeywell proprietary internal studies (MES and ECS, weight 
fuel-burn penalty, etc.), and Honeywell proprietary engine models (FID fuel-saving potential). The 
value  reflected  in  Aircraft  Systems  reflects  the  adjusted  results  of  a  previous  unpublished 
Honeywell study, which traded the benefits of a MEA vs pneumatic bleed aircraft architecture. In 
this assessment, the RFCPS in a MEA with electric main engine start and electric driven VCS/ECS 
is compared with a conventional GT-powered system using pneumatic AC/ECS and MES.  

The maturity of mobile regenerative FC technology lags that of the automotive PEMFCPS. As no 
credible data exists for quantitative implementation assessment, an analogous analysis technique 
is  therefore  used  for  qualitative  assessment.  As  with  the  PEMFCPS,  the  RFCPS  benefits  from 
being sized to an average power requirement, which is much smaller than the conventional GT 

16 

 
 
 
APU.  The  weight  of  the  system  is  estimated  to  be  slightly  lighter  than  that  of  the  PEMFCPS 
because: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The energy required is less than 50 percent of a PEMFCPS implementation; therefore, the 
hydrogen fuel system weighs less. 
Oxygen and its storage is required, which weighs less than that of the hydrogen for half the 
volume required. 
The stacks construction is non-flow-through (NFT) design, therefore, smaller in size for 
the same power. 
The stack can be of smaller size due to ~10X higher reactant partial pressure resulting in 
higher current density. 
Since  the  system  does  not  require  air  blowers/compressors,  the  balance  of  plant  should 
consume less power and weigh less. 
Only one battery is required to supplement the transient-power capability on the RFCPS 
because  its  transient  response  is  faster  than  the  air  breathing  PEMFCPS.  The 
conventional/baseline system has two batteries.

Even  though  the  RFCPS  provides  functionality  identical  to  the  PEMFCPS  and  weighs  slightly 
more than the PEMFCPS, a typical flight burns somewhat more fuel than the PEMFCPS. Since 
the  RFCPS  is  charged  by  energy  from  the  MEs,  the  ME  fuel  burn  will  be  higher  than  the 
PEMFCPS. The calculation is based on the following:

2.3.2.5  Preliminary Assessment 

Both PEMFCPS and RFCPS system weights are within estimation uncertainty, as are potential 
aviation fuel savings. 

The  preliminary  conclusion  is  that  the  RFCPS  could  be  a  technically  plausible  solution  for 
secondary or auxiliary power in the midsize narrow-body commercial air transport segment. In 
this assessment, the system appears to have comparable weight as conventional systems. Because 
it requires main engine operation to regenerate H2 and O2 in flight, it cannot claim to completely 
eliminate system exhaust emissions. However, since these occur in flight, the impact on ground-
level pollution is still minimized. This system is inherently quiet, to the benefit of passengers, ramp 
workers,  and  airport  neighborhoods.  The  system  weight  will  certainly  change  and  will  likely 
increase as development progresses; however, it is not expected to increase beyond the plausible 
limit. 

This finding is, of course, contingent on several basic assumptions, which may or may not come 
to pass. Key among these assumptions are: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The implementation of an MEA in future aircraft. As such, the fuel cell system is required 
only  to  produce  DC  electrical  power  at  a  specific  voltage,  which  is  subsequently 
conditioned/controlled as  needed by the system. Likewise, electrical  power required for 
balance of plant (BOP) functions, including sensors, fans, pumps, actuators, are provided 
from either an internal source or the aircraft power buses.  
Onboard battery power is used to supplement or absorb RFCPS power during transients. 
For this application only, a single 48v XX Amp Hr battery is assumed. 
The  implementation  of  a  hydrogen  infrastructure  at  airports  to  support  refueling  of  the 
aircraft secondary/auxiliary power systems. 
The  willingness  of  air  carriers  to  forgo  terminal  independence,  to  require  that  airport 
terminals  provide  both  cabin  air  ventilation  and  temperature  control,  as  well  as  electric 
power. Given that these aircraft will have an efficient ECS, electric power for the VCS/ECS 
could be a substitute for conditioned air from the terminal. 
These aircrafts are not required to operate with ETOPS. 

Extended operation of the RFCPS will affect the size and weight of the onboard hydrogen fuel 
system. The system used in this plausibility assessment operates only for 47 minutes per flight. 
System/value trades  could dedicate more storage weight, for additional RFCPS operating time, 
enabling ETOPS or time-limited terminal independence. Technology improvements in hydrogen 
storage, gravitational efficiency would benefit the system with longer durations.

2.3.3  Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power System (SOFCPS) 

Solid oxide fuel cells have been in development in one form or another since the 1950s. They were 
initially developed as stationary power sources, often as part of a bottoming cycle, or cogeneration 
application. Characteristic of SOFCPS, the stack operates at elevated temperatures, >800C. As a 
result, it has the capability to reform conventional logistics fuels, and does not use precious metals 
for catalysis. Also, characteristic of these systems, they use high-temperature materials and have 
poor cyclic life and poor transient operational characteristics. The SOFCPS is also more tolerant 
to  sulfides  in  the  fuel  than  a  low  temperature  PEMFCPS,  though  sulfides  do  contribute  to  a 
performance reduction.  

The ideal  implementation  in  commercial  transport aircraft  is  a power system  that continuously 
stays  on,  except  for  scheduled  maintenance.  For  the  same  reason,  the  SOFCPS  is 
ineffective/inefficient  in  dealing  with  transient  states;  and  is  better  suited  for  providing  base 
loading. The SOFCPS provides power throughout the flight profile, so the ME can be relieved of 
all parasitic power extraction and be more efficient in providing propulsive power. 

To  improve  the  overall  system  performance  and  weight,  the  SOFCPS  provides  additional 
functions, such as heat for galley services, oxygen-depleted air (ODA) for fuel tank inerting, and 
recovered water to support the various aircraft hotel services. 

2.3.3.1  Target Market Segment 

Future A SOFCPS is most likely to be used in a wide-body aircraft designed for intercontinental 
flights (similar to the Boeing 777/787 and Airbus A350), with a typical range between 3,000 – 
9,000 nautical miles. As high-utilization aircraft can operate for more than 20 hours per day, the 
SOFCPS can operate continuously without shutdown, except for scheduled maintenance. 

2.3.3.2  Concept of Operation 

The  SOFCPS  provides  all-time  power  supply,  even  when  parked.  System  shutdown  is  for 
maintenance only.

2.3.3.4  Potential System Description 

The schematic in Figure 6 describes the system concept for application of the SOFCPS to a large, 
wide-body commercial air transport. A fraction of the cabin outflow air is compressed with the 
cathode compressor (CC) and flows into the SOFC cathode. Liquid fuel from either a dedicated 
fuel tank or from the aircraft fuel tank with ultra-low or de-sulfurized fuel is pumped into a steam 
reformer, where it is converted into a gaseous mixture of CO, CO2, H2, and H2O, and fed into the 
SOFC anode at high temperature. The pressure on both cathode and anode streams are similar. The 
catalytic reaction within the stack reacts the H2 in the anode gas stream with O2 in the cathode gas 
stream to generate DC electric power which is conditioned and fed into the DC electrical power 
bus. The anode and cathode discharge gas streams are mixed and sent through a catalytic burner 
that  augments  the  steam  reformer,  and  further  depletes  the  residual  oxygen  from  the  cathode 
reaction, reacting it to consume the CO and residual H2 from the anode stream. This high-pressure 
effluent is then expanded through a power turbine (PT) that drives the CC. The expanded gas is 
cooled through a steam generator (SG), pre-cooler, economizer, and condenser to distill out water 
for cabin use and ODA for fire suppression and fuel tank inerting. Excess power from the cathode 
turbo-compressor (CC+PT) can be extracted through a generator and fed back into the electrical 
power bus. 

As  noted,  the  SOFC  is  intended  to  provide  only  base  power  since  it  does  not  tolerate  thermal 
cycling, so a discrete regenerative PEM fuel cell is used to provide or absorb power during load 
transients.  

20 

 
Figure 6. Preliminary integrated and hybridized SOFCPS for wide-body aircraft 

2.3.3.4.1  Power Demand 

Power demand is based on scaling from the Boeing 787 to a new system architecture. The Boeing 
787 can provide 1 MW of electrical power, which covers peak demand and failure cases. If the 
SOFCPS is to provide like-for-like replacement of 1 MW power generation, the system weight 
would weight 22 metric ton. This is extremely impractical and unlikely to be implemented. 

Based  on  the  assumptions,  at  43,000-feet  cruise  altitude,  the  cabin  air  compressor  consumes 
approximately  320  kW,  to  maintain  enough  fresh  air  flow  to  support  440  passengers  (787-10 
maximum  seating).  Wing  anti-icing  consumes  up  to  160  kW  of  electric  power.  Based  on  the 
assumptions, the total of 480 kW can be excluded from the SOFCPS demand. 

The  remaining  peak  electric  power  demand  from  SOFCPS  is  520  kW.  The  hybridized  RFCPS 
covers the 120 kW, and the integrated GT covers the 65 kW. The actual size of the SOFC is 335 
kW. 

The SOFCPS also provides up to 250 kW of continuous thermal power for wing-icing protection. 

2.3.3.4.2  Fuel 

One unique aspect of the SOFCPS is that it reforms hydro-carbon fuel to create its own hydrogen-
enriched  fuel.  This  hydro-carbon  fuel  can  be  shared  with  the  ME.  However,  common  jet  fuel 
contains sulfur, which is a poison to the FC and must be removed. Fuel desulfurization equipment 
is heavy and hazardous; therefore, it’s assumed the aircraft will have a dedicated fuel tank to accept 
sulfur-free fuel, either processed on ground at the airport, or specialty fuel such as bio-fuel. The 
sulfur-free fuel can be used by the GT engine, so it can count as reserve fuel, without adding weight 
to the aircraft fuel system. 

21 

 
  
 
2.3.3.4.3  Weight 

As apparent in system description 2.3.3.4  , the SOFCPS requires extensive integration with the 
aircraft to minimize the weight impact and maximize the overall system efficiency.  

In this case, the 335-kW-rated SOFCPS will weigh over 7,000 kg. Roughly half the weight can be 
credited from equipment it replaces, water it recovers, or fuel-burn saving from improved MEs. 
There may be other areas within the aircraft structure that can be improved, but the gains from 
wholesale change are difficult to speculate, and the system size and weight are too complex to 
assess under this  study. There may be areas  to  uncover in  the NCD that can further justify the 
adaptation of SOFCPS. 

2.3.3.5  Preliminary Assessment 

Unlike the other fuel cell systems evaluated, the SOFCPS (as described in the integration example 
above) can operate from logistics-type fuels, though a sulfur-free, or extremely low sulfur content 
will be required. It also augments, or replaces existing aircraft systems for:  

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Provides all electric power for aircraft operation, including emergency power 
Provides thermal power for galley operation and wing anti-ice 
Water for cabin lavatory use 
ODA for fuel tank inerting and cargo-hold fire suppression. 
Emergency oxygen  

On the negative side, the system is very heavy. In this preliminary assessment, less than half of the 
7000  kg  SOFC  system  weight  was  offset  by  synergy  and  fuel-weight  savings.  The  NCD  may 
further  improve  and  optimize  in  the  areas  below  to  make  the  architecture  plausible  for 
implementation and expose inherent safety hazards. 

2.4  CONCLUSIONS 

This analysis concludes that the implementation of PEMFCPS, RFCPS, and SOFCPS is plausible. 
The  next  three  sections  discuss  the  NCD  of  each  technology.  The  goal  is  not  about  whether  a 
certain FCPS will be implemented, but to explore and expose potential safety hazards associated 
with these new technologies for aircraft application. 

3.  NOTIONAL CONCEPT DESIGN – PEMFCPS 

3.1  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 

With the objective of identifying potential hazards and safety-related concerns, the NCD builds 
upon the initial plausibility assessment by establishing, in as much detail as possible, the functions 
of the candidate fuel system within the aircraft; identifying the components of the system, their 
location  within  the  aircraft;  identifying  installation  interfaces;  and  the  potential  safety  issues 
around system service, including refueling and maintainability.  

Having established plausibility for the PEMFCPS, this target market segment is for service in a 
commercial narrow-body air transport aircraft with less than 180 passengers, with short to mid-

22 

 
range capability, servicing US domestic routing. The typical aircraft would need the PEMFCPS to 
provide: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Electric power—both 28 VDC and ±135 VDC—for basic and necessary functions during 
periods when no other means of power storage devices can reasonably achieve the similar 
result. The ±135 VDC powers high-electrical, power demand systems such as vapor-cycle 
compressors (VCCs) motor and ME starter motor. 
Electric  power  to  start  an  ME  on  ground.  PEMFCPS  provides  such  power  while 
maintaining functionalities of the aircraft flight deck, internal lighting, and communication. 
In-flight emergency electrical power in the event of an engine or engine-mounted generator 
failure;  providing  50  percent  of  emergency  power  in  flight  within  5  seconds  and  full 
emergency power in 30 seconds, in order to maintain control of the aircraft in functions 
such as flight deck, communication, and flight control, to safely land the aircraft. 
Electric power to meet aircraft electric-power demand during the flight’s descent phase so 
the  MEs  can  be  set  to  lower  throttle  position  to  save  a  considerable  amount  of  liquid 
aviation fuel. 
Standby  power  mode  to  produce  minimum  power  (at  highest  efficiency)  to  support 
functions  while  the  aircraft  is  unattended,  e.g.,  functions  such  as  keeping  temperature-
sensitive equipment in desired condition. 

The PEMFCPS consumes compressed hydrogen gas, which is stored on board the aircraft, and 
will be replenished before each flight. The fuel truck services the hydrogen fuel tank, like the way 
that  the  liquid  fuel  truck  services  the  jet  fuel  tank.  The  PEMFCPS  cathode  is  supplied  with 
pressure-boosted  air from  the cabin,  and  the exhaust  is  discharged overboard. A  liquid-cooling 
circuit is used to transfer PEMFCPS waste energy to ambient air as heat sink. The PEMFCPS may 
include Li-ion main aircraft batteries for optimized performance.

3.1.1  Secondary Functions 

There are secondary functions that the PEMFCPS can potentially provide, usually at the expense 
of  size,  weight,  and  complexity.  The  implementation  of  these  functions  will  be  case-by-case 
detailed design options, which is not in the scope of this research. While these functions were not 
included  in  the  top-level  assessment  discussed  in  the  previous  sections,  they  could  be  justified 
given the following discussion.  

Fuel Tank Inerting 

The waste products from PEMFCPS operation is steam-saturated ODA. Based on general design 
practice, the dry ODA contains in the range of 9–13 percent of oxygen. Though the oxygen content 
is within the right range for fuel tank inerting, there are two barriers: 

• 

• 

Fuel tank inerting requires a supply of ODA to replace the volume of the consumed fuel 
during the entire duration of the flight. However, the concept of operation for PEMFCPS 
implementation  in  narrow-body,  air  transport  aircraft  limits  the  inflight  operation  to 
emergency operation and during aircraft descent.  
The cathode outflow ODA is over-saturated with water from FC reaction. This water must 
be removed from the ODA, otherwise the condensed water will cause serious damage to 
the aircraft fuel system.  

Operating the PEMFCPS in fractional power during flight to produce the correct amount of ODA 
for fuel tank inerting is plausible but may not have an obvious benefit. The part power efficiency 
would be noticeably higher, and the ME fuel burn would benefit by not providing bleed air for the 
fuel tank inerting system (FTIS) and lessened load on electric generators.  

Simple calculation suggests that to continuously provide adequate fuel tank inerting ODA to the 
tank, the PEMFCPS must operate at approximately 40 kW, or 35 percent of full electric power 
during  the  entire  flight.  At  an  efficiency  of  60  percent,  the  hydrogen  burn  rate  will  be 
approximately  2.0  kg/hour,  and  for  a  five-hour  flight,  9.8  kg  of  hydrogen  fuel  is  consumed, 
resulting in 178 kg increase in FSS. Add the weight of water-removal equipment (assuming 20 
kg), subtract 44 kg for the SOA FTIS and 84 kg water that is no longer needed on board, the net is 
13 kg weight gain.  

Combined  with  the  recovery  of  water  removed  from  the  ODA  for  lavatory  use,  the  additional 
weight is in the estimation uncertainty range. The additional volume of 171 liter is significant but 
may be tolerable. One side benefit of this configuration is that there is sufficient hydrogen fuel on 
board for ETOPS certification. Table 10 shows the weight comparison.

3.1.1.1  Potable Water Recovery 

The ODA contains water as a byproduct, which may be recovered to reduce the amount of water 
the aircraft has to carry at takeoff. A trade must be made between the weight of water recovery 
equipment and water recovered. However, if the configuration is set to provide fuel tank inerting, 
then water recovery is part of the system 

Based on the Near-Term Implementation Analysis (NTIA) and assumptions, only about 3 kg of 
hydrogen  is  used  during  routine  flights,  if  90  percent  of  the  water  byproduct  is  recovered,  it 
amounts  to  24  kg  of  water.  It  may  sound  plausible  for  a  positive  trade  against  water  recovery 
equipment. However, the PEMFCPS only begins to produce water at the end of the cruise, when 
water usage from that point on is minimal. 

3.1.1.2  Cargo Hold Fire Suppression 

Like fuel tank inerting, ODA can also be used to suppress cargo-hold fire to save the weight of 
halon bottles. An experiment done at Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Technology Center 
Laboratory has demonstrated that the ODA alone is inadequate to distinguish fire in cargo hold 
but maintains suppression after the fire was distinguished by halon. Also, same shortcoming as 
fuel  tank  inerting  function,  there  is  no  reliable  and  sufficient  source  of  ODA  to  perform  this 
function when needed in a timely fashion. 

3.1.1.3  Waste Heat Reuse 

Although the FC stack generates slightly more waste heat as its output electrical power (40 percent 
average  system  efficiency  assumed),  due  to  its  relatively  low  temperature,  very  little  heating 
application can benefit from it. 

The nearest consumer of this low-quality waste heat would be the aft galley for pre-heating food 
and  beverages.  Based  on  the  NTIA  rationale  and  assumptions,  the  single-aisle  aircraft  usually 
doesn’t provide heated meals, and the wasted heat is not quite hot enough for heated beverages 
such as coffee. The assumption is these services are unlikely to be provided when the plane starts 
to descend, the only time the system is on during the flight. 

Even  if  the  design  intended  to  use  PEMFCPS  during  flight,  the  ambient  temperature  at  cruise 
altitude  is  extremely  cold;  the  heat  load  from  solar,  in-flight  entertainment,  and  passenger’s 
metabolism can offset the heat loss through the skin of the aircraft. For most of the time, the ECS 
is in cooling mode. On rare occasions such as an empty cabin with no warm body, the heating is 
needed, which will be easily satisfied through the heat of compression by cabin pressurization. 

3.2  REQUIREMENTS  

The requirements will be based on the assumptions listed in the NTIA.

3.2.1  Performance 

The top-level performance requirement for notional design is derived from NTIA, which includes 
high-level  trade  against  modern  GT  APU  in  terms  of  hardware  and  ME  fuel-burn  credits  and 
penalties.

3.3  NOTIONAL DESIGN 

The notional design of the PEMFCPS is intended to be generic. The goal is to explore and expose 
new safety hazards introduced by the introduction of new technologies. 

The  design  of  any  system  is  an  iterative  process.  This  notional  design  presents  the  final 
representation because of these iterations. Efforts has been made to capture some of the rationale 
during the design process. 

3.3.1  System Description (Schematics) 

The core of the PEMFCPS is well defined in automotive industry implementations and is directly 
applicable for aircraft. The schematic diagram in Figure 7 illustrates the basic design of the system. 
Most of the functions such as flow control, reactants hydration, etc. are somewhat proprietary to 
individual manufacturers, and are considered internal to the unit, therefore, not discussed in this 
report. 

30 

 
 
 
Figure 7. Typical PEMFCPS schematic diagram 

3.3.2  System Layouts 

For aircraft implementation, the PEMFCPS can be configured in many ways to better integrate 
into other existing aircraft systems. Two system configurations with high implementation potential 
were examined. 

3.3.2.1  System Configuration #1 

The rationale for this configuration is to have two half-sized (60kW) subsystems for redundancy, 
co-located with ECS pack to take advantage of synergy in thermal  handling characteristics and 
potential sharing of common equipment among the two. The other consideration is to separate the 
power generation unit (PGU) [stack and BOP] from the energy source (hydrogen storage system) 
for isolation by space, in case of failure. Figure 8 illustrates the high-level system layout.

The potential benefit of co-locating the PEMFCPS and ECS are: 

1. 
2. 

3. 

Cathode air can be taken from cabin at recirculating duct. 
Cooling air can use the same ambient cooling air system, including the cooling fan (ground 
operation), ram air (flight) inlet and exhaust plenum and ducting. 
Large electric power users such as VCCs and ME S/G are short coupled or even through 
private bus for less weight on cable and electric power control and distribution. 

The FSS will be located inside the tail cone where the traditional GT APU is usually located. There 
are  many  irregularly  shaped  spaces  behind  the  pressure  bulkhead,  where  a  large  size  spherical 
pressure vessel may be situated. 

Other  perceived  benefits  also  include  no  designated  fire  zone  (DFZ)  due  to  its  relatively  low 
operating temperature and maintains aircraft center of gravity (CG). 

The downside of this layout is that the long, pressurized hydrogen fuel transmission line between 
the FSS and PGU, most likely must go in and out of the pressure vessel in the cargo hold area. 
Double containment of the fuel transmission line and active purge within the second containment 
is needed. 

3.3.2.2  System Configuration #2 

The rationale for this system layout is to eliminate the hazard of bringing pressurized hydrogen 
gas through pressurized zone and the close proximity to the liquid jet fuel tanks. 

The  entire  PEMFCPS  will  be  located  inside  the  unpressurized  tail  cone  behind  the  pressure 
bulkhead.  Since  this  arrangement  is  in  an  unpressurized  enclosure  and  does  not  require  long, 
pressurized  hydrogen  fuel  transmission  run,  the  double  containment  and  active  purge  air  are 
unnecessary. However, passive ventilation must be provided for the PEMFCPS compartment by 
at  least  two ventilation  openings, preferably  with bottom  intake and  top-vent  exhaust,  to  avoid 
flammable  gas  from  accumulating  during  the  period  when  the  system  is  off.  Provision  for 
introducing ram air to purge out the compartment when the aircraft is in motion is also required. 

The main drawback of this layout is that the total weight of the system (including dedicated cooling 
fans, plenums, and doors) is located at the extreme aft of the aircraft and may impact the CG of 
the aircraft unless it is designed into the aircraft structure. 

The generic aircraft digital model shown in Figure 10 illustrates the configuration and potential 
impact to the aircraft weight balance.

3.3.3  Subsystems 

This section provides a verbal description of the subsystems. 

3.3.3.1  Stack 

Use of cabin air as cathode reactant can improve performance during flight and keep stack from 
icing.  Electric  strip  heater  and  thermal  insulation  shall  be  applied  to  the  stack  to  keep  it  from 
freezing and cause damage to the membrane. 

To keep the stack from icing, a combination of the following steps may be taken: 

•  Keep a minimum stream of cabin air flowing around the stack, or 
•  Wrap the stack with electric strip heater and thermal insulation, or 
•  Set to standby mode to have a minimum flow of reactants to keep system above freezing while 

providing power for control and monitoring system. 

All safety features from automotive fuel cell implementation may be applied. 

3.3.3.2  Fuel System 

3.3.3.2.1  Pressure Vessel 

The  high-pressure  hydrogen  will  be  stored  in  a  700  bar,  Type  IV  pressure  vessel.  Spherical  is 
preferred over cylindrical for better fuel weight fraction performance, due to more accommodating 
space available inside the aircraft tail cone. 

34 

 
 
The pressure vessel shall be strap-mounted to avoid any concentrated stress-loading, which may 
compromise the integrity of the pressure vessel. Figure 11 shows an example of the strap-mount 
vessel of Saturn V engine. 

Figure 11. Example of the strap-mount vessel of Saturn V engine 

Hydrogen gas leakage may pose an explosion hazard due to the enclosed nature of aircraft fuselage. 
Gas accumulation inside the compartment shall be avoided by passive ram air purge and natural 
draft design. 

3.3.3.2.2  Pressure Relief Devices 

The fuel tank will be protected by multiple pressure-relief devices (PRDs) for various conditions: 

• 
• 
• 

Rupture disc for overfilling, overheating-caused gas expansion 
Fusible plugs placed strategically to protect from localized high temperature 
Safety relief valve at each pressure segment of the fuel system  

All gas relief shall be connected into a protective passage and vent to ambient away from potential 
ignition source. 

3.3.3.2.3  Pressure Regulating Valves 

The hydrogen gas pressure must be reduced to a safe value for handling before the flow can be 
modulated  for  load  control.  There  shall  be  in-tank  pressure-reducing  valve,  and  back-pressure 
regulating  valve  to  safeguard  the  low-pressure  fuel  lines  due  to  potential  pressure  built  up  by 
allowable leakage through the rate of the pressure reducing valve. 

35 

 
 
3.3.3.2.4  Fuel Transmission 

The high-pressure hydrogen gas shall be reduced from its storage pressure of up to 10,000 psig to 
medium  pressure  (100 –  150 psig) for transmission once it leaves  the storage system. Cascade 
pressure-reducing  arrangement  shall  be  considered  when  appropriate.  The  pressure  of  the 
hydrogen gas is further reduced to stack pressure (15 – 60 psig) for consumption. 

Efforts shall be made to minimize gas line connection fittings to minimize leakage. 

The transmission line shall be doubly contained when trespassing closed or pressurized spaces to 
avoid accumulation of hydrogen gas. The secondary containment volume shall be purged by air or 
inert gas actively or passively always. 

Hydrogen gas monitoring devices shall be employed to monitor the secondary volume in case of 
insufficient purge flow. 

3.3.3.2.5  Fuel System Purge Control 

Purge of the anode is often necessary to rid of impurities during hydrogen gas production to clear 
out gas impurities. This purge of concentrated hydrogen gas with impurities happens inside the 
pressurized vessels and shall be led to ambient safely. 

The purge of the space between the fuel line and its secondary containment, i.e., double-walled 
pipe/tube shall be continuous either by natural draft, or actively purged by other gases such as air 
or inert gas to maintain a combustible gas outside the explosion limits. When active purge system 
is employed, the combustible gas concentration shall be monitored when the active purging is off. 

3.3.3.2.6  Leak Detection 

Since the current SOA hydrogen gas detector is relatively slow to react in time to prevent sudden 
release of hydrogen-caused fire or explosion, and the installed location may not always have the 
worst  gas  mixture  condition,  computational  fluid  dynamics  analysis  must  be  performed  to 
determine optimal sensor location. 

3.3.3.3  Power Generation System 

The  power  generation  system  consists  of  FC  stack  and  its  immediate  surrounding  devices  to 
maintain its healthy and productive condition. 

3.3.3.3.1  Air Management System 

The air management subsystem focuses mainly on the management of cathode air to condition it 
to the optimal condition in temperature, pressure, humidity, cleanliness, and mass rate of flow. 

Components  include  turbomachinery  for  pressure  manipulation,  heat  exchangers  (HEXs)  for 
temperature control, filter for cleanliness, and valves and fitting. 

36 

 
3.3.3.3.2  Air Distribution and Control 

Cathode air is taken from the pressurized cabin, which maintains tight range of conditions for FCs 
stability in performance and life. 

The air can be branched from  the main ECS recirculating  duct  for system  configuration #1, or 
through  the  rear-pressure  bulkhead  for  system  configuration  #2.  An  in-line  air  filter  should  be 
placed before the air enters the PEMFCPS. 

The aircraft PEMFCPS can take advantage of the pressure difference between  cabin  and high-
altitude ambient to recover energy to augment compressor drive. Although this feature may not be 
implemented in  automotive applications, it is  common for aircraft air management system.  No 
new safety hazard is expected.  

3.3.3.3.3  Turbomachinery 

The  turbomachine  comprises  three  major  components—inlet  air  fan/booster/compressor, 
motor/generator,  and  a  turbine—that  are  connected  through  a  common  shaft.  This  is  the  only 
device in the PEMFCPS implementation that involves kinetic energy from rotating components 
with a very high rate of speed. The size and energy contained is much smaller when compared 
with the APU or ECS of the existing aircraft. 

3.3.3.3.4  Compartment Area Purging and Ventilation 

In  either  layout  arrangement,  the  FCPS  resides  in  an  unpressurized  compartment.  This 
compartment shall be constantly purged by ambient air and vents overboard while in operation. 

There  shall  be  either  active  ventilation  fan  (system  configuration  #1)  or  passive  natural  draft 
ventilation with vent doors below and above the tail cone (system configuration #2) to ascertain 
there is no hydrogen gas accumulation especially during the time when the system is off. 

3.3.3.4  Thermal Management System (TMS) 

The PEMFCPS operates at an efficiency range of 45 percent - 55 percent, which means the heat is 
generated by the stack at a rate that is slightly greater than the electrical power output. This heat 
must be removed, and temperature maintained for continuous safe operation of the system. 

3.3.3.4.1  Liquid Cooling Loop 

To achieve higher-power density of FCPS at or above this power level, liquid cooling is necessary 
to remove the amount of waste heat from such a compact package. The liquid cooling is preferably 
a closed loop with anti-freezing property due to the very low heat sink temperature at altitude. This 
system is rather common for aviation application and poses minimal safety hazard. 

3.3.3.4.2  Heat Sink 

Cathode  air  provides  some  level  of  cooling  for  the  FC  stack;  the  majority  of  the  waste  heat  is 
removed by ambient air. 

37 

 
3.3.3.5  Electric Power System 

The electrical system shown in the simplified diagram in Figure 12 was set as a baseline typical of 
a twin-engine, single-aisle commercial air transport aircraft. The primary power generation is from 
115/200VAC, 3-phase, 4-wire generators on the MEs, and a 115/200VAC S/G on the turbine APU, 
or 115/200VAC ground power. Emergency power is provided by a 115/200VAC RAT generator, 
and by a 28VDC battery. 28VDC power is derived from the 115/200VAC buses via transformer-
rectifier units (TRUs). The MEs start pneumatically, with bleed air from the APU being supplied 
to air turbine starters. The APU start electrically from either 115/200VAC or the 28VDC battery. 
The start power unit (SPU) either rectifies 115/200VAC to ~270VDC or boosts the battery voltage 
to  ~270VDC.  The  start  converter  unit  (SCU)  converts  this  270VDC  into  variable  amplitude, 
variable frequency alternating current (AC) to drive the S/G. 

Figure 12. Simplified electrical system diagram - Current 

When  an  FCPS  replaces  the  turbine  APU,  several  changes  are  needed.  While  the  simplified 
architecture shown in Figure 13 incorporates the FCPS, it attempts to minimize electrical system 
changes and consequent power user equipment changes. Since an FCPS supplies DC output, an 
inverter is required to generate 115/200VAC. Additionally, because the auxiliary power system 
(APS) no longer has a source of compressed (bleed) air, the MEs must be started electrically via 
an SCU and S/G. The other function of an APS is to provide power to the aircraft ECS for air 
conditioning on ground. A turbine APU would typically provide compressed air to an air-cycle 
ECS,  this  same  ECS  being  fed  by  ME  bleed  air  in  flight.  The  FCPS  requires  that  the  ECS  be

electrically powered, which is a significant change to the aircraft systems. This power would be 
provided from the +/-135VDC bus in volts alternating current. 

This  increased  use  of  electrical  power,  and,  in  particular,  higher-voltage  DC  drives  additional 
considerations and technology needs, as discussed below. 

3.3.3.5.1  High Voltage DC Switching and Protection 

High-voltage  DC  primary  power  distribution  contactors  are  heavier  and  more  expensive  than 
traditional AC contactors to withstand switch contact arcing. Ideally, they need to be high-power, 
solid-state, power controller (SSPC) modules to provide fast switching since the pass-through fault 
energy before an electromechanical contactor opens (typically a 20-30mS period) and can cause 
significant  arcing.  This  effect  is  much  less  pronounced  in  AC  systems  since  the  arc  self-
extinguishes during zero-crossing. Such high-power SSPCs are not commercially available. As in 
current  SSPC-based  secondary  distribution  systems,  fail-short  protection  must  be  included  and 
must prevent the charging of load capacitance by leakage current, which is particularly important 
for personnel safety in these high-voltage systems. SSPCs must be lightning-immune and need to 
be able to withstand or control load-capacitive, inrush currents. 

Arc fault detection/protection is an important feature in high-voltage DC systems. It must be able 
to detect different arc types and minimize false trips due to transients and normal loads. Protection-
level  coordination  is  required  to  ensure  that  only  the  furthest  downstream  protection  device  is 
activated. 

Corona/partial discharge is an important consideration in high-voltage systems. The choice of +/-
135VDC (or even +/-270VDC) allows standard insulation systems and design practices to be used. 

39 

 
Figure 13. Simplified electrical system diagram - PEMFCPS 

3.3.3.5.2  Power Quality Including Transient Response 

While 270VDC systems have been used for several years in some military fighter jet applications, 
use of high-voltage DC in commercial air transport has been limited, and where used, it typically 
has been locally distributed and used for a few specific loads. 

Power  quality,  including  transient  response,  is  an  important  consideration.  To  avoid  excessive 
voltage excursions, the transient response of an FCPS needs to be carefully considered. This may 
necessitate including energy storage (batteries) as part of the FCPS. The FCPS output may need 
to be fed to the bus via a DC-DC converter to enable sufficient voltage control and energy storage 
power management. This DC-DC converter could also provide power control/current limiting (by 
reducing the supplied steady-state voltage), but this is not effective with constant power loads. 

Preventing FCPS overload requires load limiting (load-shedding). It also is recommended that the 
distribution  system  provides  for  the  staging  load-on  transient  (applying  different  loads  in 
sequence)  so  that  the  FCPS  has  time  to  respond  and  provide  the  required  power  without 
permanently damaging the system components and degrading performance. 

While load-off transient cannot be controlled in all circumstances, an FCPS typically responds and 
operates safely in open-circuit condition.

3.4  MAINTENANCE AND RELIABILITY 

Since the PEMFCPS employs a very clean process, the anticipated maintenance activities will be 
limited to replacement of air filter, coolant filter, and water-accumulation traps. 

The individual or groups of stack cells performance shall be constantly  monitored, trended for 
health management. The ability to isolate collapsed cells to maintain integrity of the system is also 
important. 

The  implementation  approach  of  the  PEMFCPS  will  likely  be  modular  so  most,  if  not  all, 
subsystems may be line replacement units. 

3.5  CONCLUSION 

Most systems required for PEMFCPS use currently operative technologies, for which the hazards 
have  been  understood  and  addressed.  However,  some,  such  as  the  high-voltage  direct  current 
(HVDC) system, have been well developed in military systems, and have been adapted and studied 
in MEA applications. 

New  safety  hazards  introduced  by  PEMFCPS  technology  revolve  mainly  around  high-pressure 
gas, combustible gases, where ventilation is essential to avoid accumulation. DFZ is not necessary 
because the PEMFCPS does not involve liquid fuel and is operating in low temperature, like power 
batteries. 

PEMFCPS performance may be hindered by icing due to an abundance of moisture in the system 
and a wide range of ambient-temperature swing between ground and high altitude. If offered, a 
fuel  tank  inerting  option  may  introduce  moisture  into  aviation  fuel  tanks,  causing  corrosion  to 
structure and potential ice crystal blocking fuel control system. Overall,  while many additional 
functions considered to boost the PEMFCPS implementation justification are well intended, due 
to  the  limitation  on  hydrogen  fuel  quantity  (volume  and  weight)  and  nature  of  timing,  only 
electrical power generation may be implemented with a potential positive trade outcome. 

4.  NOTIONAL CONCEPT DESIGN – RFCPS 

4.1  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 

As previously noted, the initial target market for the RFCPS is the narrow body with less than 180 
passengers, short to mid-range aircraft, servicing US domestic air transport segment. The main 
function of RFCPS is to provide electric power. Contrary to the current trend of aircraft secondary 
(non-propulsive) power  evolution,  the implementation  of RFCPS encourages  minimized power 
demand when in power-generation mode and maximized regeneration duration for optimal weight. 
The role of RFCPS is applicable when other forms of power are unavailable and usually in short 
duration due to the limited fuel capacity. 

In this application, the RFCPS provides electric power for basic and necessary functions during 
periods when no other means of power storage devices can reasonably achieve the similar result. 
These basic functions are: 

41 

 
• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Electric power—both 28 VDC and ±135 VDC—for basic and necessary functions during 
periods when no other means of power storage devices can reasonably achieve the similar 
result. The ±135 VDC powers high-electrical, power demand systems such as VCCs motor 
and ME starter motor. 
Electric  power  to  start  an  ME  on  ground.  PEMFCPS  provides  such  power  while 
maintaining functionalities of the aircraft flight deck, internal lighting, and communication. 
In-flight emergency electrical power in the event of an engine or engine-mounted generator 
failure;  providing  50  percent  of  emergency  power  in  flight  within  5  seconds  and  full 
emergency power in 30 seconds, in order to maintain control of the aircraft in functions 
such as flight deck, communication, and flight control, to safely land the aircraft. 
Electric power to meet aircraft electric-power demand during the flight’s descent phase so 
the  MEs  can  be  set  to  lower  throttle  position  to  save  a  considerable  amount  of  liquid 
aviation fuel. 
Standby  power  mode  to  produce  minimum  power  (at  highest  efficiency)  to  support 
functions  while  the  aircraft  is  unattended,  e.g.,  functions  such  as  keeping  temperature-
sensitive equipment in desired condition. 

The RFCPS is in regeneration mode whenever excess power is available from other sources such 
as gate power or ME generators, and in power-generation mode whenever power is needed and 
unavailable economically from other sources. 

Table 17 summarizes RFCPS functions during different phases of the operation.

Though the FC stack generates slightly less waste heat as its output electrical power (55 percent 
average system power generation efficiency assumed), due to its relatively low temperature and 
short duration, no viable heating application can benefit from it.

4.2  REQUIREMENTS 

Based  on  the  implementation  rationale,  assumptions,  and  functions  served  by  the  RFCPS,  this 
section discusses the requirement for the notional design. 

4.2.1  Performance 

The top-level performance requirement for notional design is derived from NTIA, which includes 
high-level  trade  against  modern  GT  APU  in  terms  of  hardware  and  ME  fuel-burn  credits  and 
penalties.

The  notional  design  of  the  RFCPS  is  intended  to  be  generic.  Since  the  goal  of  this  study  is  to 
explore  and  expose  new  hazards  caused  by  the  introduction  of  new  fuel  cell  technologies,  the 
notional design is taken only so far as to develop an understanding of these hazards, but likely 
short of that required for actual implementation. Efforts have been made to capture some of the 
rationale during the design process. 

4.3.1  System Description 

The RFCPS is a closed system that comprises two main functions—electrolysis (regeneration) and 
power generation. The electrolysis function is a reverse of the power generation function, which 
reduces water into hydrogen and oxygen gases in an endothermic reaction, using electrical power 
when there is excess available. When electric power is needed, the process switches to FC mode 
that generates electric power by combining the reactants. The entire system functions as a battery. 
This study assumes a PEM-type FC stack. The PEMFC stack in this power range has matured in 
the automotive industry; and for its integration into a sealed regenerative system, special attention 
must be paid to changes necessary for the handling of pure oxygen and at a higher pressure.  

The  RFCPS  has  two  major  competing  configurations—discrete  and  unitized.  The  unitized 
configuration was determined earlier to be implausible due to its technology immaturity; however, 
the discrete system has merit and will be discussed further. In the discrete system, separate fuel 
cell  stacks  are  used,  each  dedicated  to  either  the  electrolysis  function  or  the  power  generation 
function.  As  such,  these  stacks  are  designed  specifically  for  their  function.  As  a  system,  the 

47 

 
 
 
 
advantage is in system performance and durability. The discrete system configuration is the most 
developed of the regenerative fuel cell power systems.  

4.3.2  System Configuration 

4.3.2.1  Discrete RFCPS 

The  rationale  for  this  configuration  is  to  have  two  separate  stacks  with  one  optimized  for 
electrolysis,  while  the  other  is  optimized  for  power  generation.  The  two  stacks  may  differ  in 
catalysts, electrolytes, and operating conditions. Figure 14 shows the discrete regenerative fuel cell 
power system (DRFCPS). 

Figure 14. DRFCPS schematic diagram 

For  the  notional  design  of  DRFCPS,  the  electrolyzer  is  arranged  in  cylindrical  shape  for  high-
electrolysis  pressure of  up to  3,000 psia; the reactants are stored in  separate spherical  pressure 
vessels. There are water extractors between the electrolyzer and storage tanks to keep water from 
entering the tanks. 

The pressure of the reactants is regulated down before entering the FC stack in power-generation 
mode.  Though  the  fuel  cell  stack  may  be  of  NFT  design,  it  may  be  good  practice  to  include 
recirculating loops, either by passive ejector or active pump, for stack hydration control. 

A liquid cooling loop is needed to remove the heat generated during power-generation process and 
released into the heat sink – ambient (ram) air.

A digital model of a generic aircraft was used to illustrate the installation and potential interactions 
between systems. 

Figure 16. Digital model rendering of the DRFCPS installation example 

Though the non-air-breathing RFCPS functions like a battery, it does require access to ambient air 
for cooling, and more importantly, ventilation. 

4.3.3  RFCPS Subsystem Descriptions 

With reference to the schematics in Figure 15 and Figure 16, the following sections provide some 
detail on those subsystems relevant to this study.  

49 

 
 
 
4.3.3.1  Discrete Electrolyzer Stack 

This PEM stack is designed for high-pressure electrolysis, which can regenerate reactants up to 
175 bar (2,500 psia). It is constructed in cylindrical shape to maintain the pressure with reasonable 
weight.  Moderate  waste  heat  from  other  processes  such  as  power-electronics  cooling  may  be 
applied for this endothermic reaction. 

4.3.3.1.1  Discrete Fuel Cell Stack 

This PEM FC stack is typically designed for a hydrogen-oxygen pair, up to 60 psia in pressure. 
This stack operates at a lower pressure than the electrolyzer stack and requires pressure regulation 
of the reactants, which are stored at a much higher pressure. As the reactants are stored locally and 
not ejected, the waste heat ejects from the stack with the mixed-phase steam. Liquid cooling is 
required to maintain its operating temperature. 

4.3.3.2  Fuel Cell Reactants System 

4.3.3.2.1  Reactant Pressure Vessels 

The high-pressure hydrogen will be stored in the 200 bar, Type IV pressure vessel. A spherical 
configuration  is  preferred  over  cylindrical  for  better  fuel-weight  fraction  performance  and  is 
enabled by space available inside the aircraft tail cone. The pressure vessel shall be strap-mounted 
to avoid any concentrated stress-loading that may compromise the integrity of the pressure vessel. 

Hydrogen gas leakage may pose a hazard due to the “more-enclosed” nature of aircraft fuselage. 
The potential hazard will be addressed by the rest of the notional design. 

Oxygen  gas  will  be  stored  in  a  similar  type  of  container  with  similar  mounting  approach.  In 
compliance with ASTM G93 and CGA G-4.1, an “oxygen clean” process must be observed while 
working on oxygen system-wetted components. 

4.3.3.2.2  Pressure-Relief Devices 

The reactant tanks will be protected by multiple PRDs for various conditions: 

• 
• 
• 

Rupture disc for overcharging, overheating-caused gas expansion  
Fusible plugs placed strategically to protect from localized high temperature  
Resealable safety relief valve in sequential arrangement 

All  high-pressure  reactants  relief  shall  be  conducted  into  a  designated  protective  passage  and 
vented to ambient away from potential ignition source or other flammable materials. 

4.3.3.2.3  Pressure Regulating Valves 

The reactants gas pressure must be reduced to a safe value for handling before the flow can be 
modulated for load control. There shall be an in-tank, pressure-reducing valve, and back-pressure 
regulating valve to safeguard the low-pressure fuel lines due to potential pressure built up by the 
allowable leakage rate of the pressure-reducing valve.  

50 

 
4.3.3.2.4  Fuel Transmission 

The high-pressure reactant gases shall be reduced from its storage pressure of (up to) 3,000 psig 
to  medium  pressure  (100  –  150  psig)  for  transmission  once  it  leaves  the  storage  system.  The 
pressure of the hydrogen gas is further reduced to stack pressure (15 – 60 psig) for consumption. 

To minimize leakage, efforts shall be made to minimize gas line connections. 

To  avoid  accumulation  of  hydrogen  gas,  the  transmission  line  shall  be doubly  contained  when 
trespassing closed or pressurized spaces. The secondary containment volume shall be purged by 
air or inert gas actively or passively at all times. 

In case of insufficient purge flow, reactant-gas monitoring devices shall be employed to monitor 
the secondary volume. 

4.3.3.2.5  Leak Detection 

The  current  state-of-the-art  (SOA)  hydrogen  gas  detector  is  relatively  slow  to  react  in  time  to 
prevent  a  sudden  release  of  hydrogen-caused  fire  or  explosion.  The  installed  location  may  not 
always have the worst gas-mixture condition. The most useful installation is to monitor the gas 
composition within the double containment, reducing the possibility of an ignition source. 

4.3.3.3  Power-Generation System 

The power-generation system inside the RFCPS mainly consists of the electrolyzer and FC stacks, 
wiring and insulation, and connectors and interconnects that transmit power into and out of the 
sealed FC stacks. Power conditioning equipment and switches, etc. would most likely be outside 
the stack assembly. In addition, there may be various sensors and other immediate surrounding 
devices to maintain the health of the stacks. 

4.3.3.3.1  Compartment Area Purging and Ventilation 

The RFCPS resides in an unpressurized compartment in the aircraft. This compartment shall be 
constantly purged by ambient air and vents overboard. 

4.3.3.4  Thermal Management System 

The RFCPS operates at  an efficiency range of 55 percent  - 65 percent,  which means  the stack 
generates heat at a rate of moderately less than the electrical power it generates. This heat needs 
to be removed to maintain a continuous safe operation of the system. There are a number of ways 
to accomplish this, the most common of which will likely use the water generated inside the stacks 
as a medium to transport this heat from the stack to an external HEX or separate liquid-cooling 
media. 

4.3.3.4.1  Liquid Cooling Loop 

To  achieve  a  higher-power  density  of  FCPS  at  this  power  level,  liquid-cooling  is  necessary  to 
remove the amount of waste heat from such a compact package. 

51 

 
The  liquid-cooling  is  preferably  a  closed  loop  with  anti-freezing  property  for  continued 
airworthiness operation. 

4.3.3.4.2  Heat Sink 

This study will assume ambient air as the heat sink. 

4.3.3.4.3  Electrolyzer Heating 

This endothermic reaction may be supplemented with heat generated electrically, or with waste 
heat from other systems such as power-electronics cooling loop if so equipped. 

4.3.3.5  Electric Power System 

The electrical system shown in the simplified diagram in Figure 17 represents a baseline typical 
of a twin-engine, single-aisle, commercial air transport aircraft. The primary power generation is 
from 115/200VAC, 3-phase, 4-wire generators on the MEs, and a 115/200VAC S/G on the turbine 
APU,  or  115/200VAC  ground  power.  Emergency  power  is  provided  by  a  115/200VAC  RAT 
generator, and by a 28VDC battery. 28VDC power is derived from the 115/200VAC buses via 
transformer-rectifier  units  (TRUs).  The  MEs  start  pneumatically,  with  bleed  air  from  the  APU 
being  supplied  to  ATS.  The  APU  starts  electrically  from  either  115/200VAC  or  the  28VDC 
battery.  The  SPU  either  rectifies  115/200VAC  to  ~270VDC  or  boosts  the  battery  voltage  to 
~270VDC.  The SCU  converts this  270VDC into variable amplitude, variable frequency AC to 
drive the S/G. 

52 

 
Figure 17. Simplified electrical system diagram - Current 

When an FCPS replaces the turbine APU, several changes need are needed. While the simplified 
architecture shown in Figure 18 incorporates the FCPS, it attempts to minimize electrical system 
changes and consequent power user equipment changes. Since an FCPS supplies DC output, an 
inverter  is  required  to  generate  115/200VAC.  Additionally,  because  the  APS  no  longer  has  a 
source of compressed (bleed) air, the MEs must be started electrically via an SCU and S/G. The 
other function of an APS is to provide power to the aircraft ECS for air conditioning on ground. A 
turbine APU would typically provide compressed air to an air-cycle ECS, this same ECS being 
fed by ME bleed air in flight. The FCPS requires that the ECS be electrically powered, which is a 
significant change to the aircraft systems. This power would be provided from the +/-135VDC bus 
in Figure 18. 

This  increased  use  of  electrical  power,  and,  in  particular,  higher-voltage  DC  drives  additional 
considerations and technology needs, as discussed below. 

4.3.3.5.1  High-Voltage DC Switching and Protection 

High  voltage  DC  primary  power  distribution  contactors  are  heavier  and  more  expensive  than 
traditional AC contactors to withstand switch contact arcing. Ideally, they need to be high-power 
SSPC  modules  to  provide  fast  switching  since  the  pass-through  fault  energy  before  an 
electromechanical  contactor  opens  (typically  a  20-30mS  period),  which  can  cause  significant 
arcing. This effect is much less pronounced in AC systems because the arc self-extinguishes during

zero-crossing. Such high power SSPCs are not commercially available. As in current SSPC-based 
secondary  distribution  systems  fail-short  protection  must  be  included  and  the  charging  of  load 
capacitance by leakage current prevented (which is particularly important for personnel safety in 
these high-voltage systems). SSPCs must be lightning immune and need to be able to withstand or 
control load capacitive inrush currents. 

Arc fault detection/protection is an important feature in high voltage DC systems. It needs to be 
able  to  detect  different  arc  types  and  minimize  false  trips  due  to  transients  and  normal  loads. 
Protection level coordination is required to ensure only the furthest downstream protection device 
is activated. 

Corona/partial discharge are important considerations in high voltage systems. The choice of +/-
135VDC (or even +/-270VDC) allows standard insulation systems and design practices to be used. 

Figure 18. Simplified electrical system diagram - PEMFUPS 

4.3.3.5.2  Power Quality Including Transient Response 

While 270VDC systems have been used for several years in some military fighter jet applications, 
use of high voltage DC in commercial air transport has been limited, and where used it has typically 
been locally distributed and used for a few specific loads.

Power  quality,  including  transient  response,  is  an  important  consideration.  To  avoid  excessive 
voltage excursions, the transient response of a FCPS needs to be carefully considered. This may 
necessitate including energy storage (batteries) as part of the FCPS. The FCPS output may need 
to be fed to the bus via a DC-DC converter to enable sufficient voltage control and energy-storage 
power management. This DC-DC converter could also provide power control/current limiting (by 
reducing the supplied steady-state voltage), but this is not effective with constant power loads. 

Preventing FCPS overload requires load limiting (load-shedding). It also is recommended that the 
distribution system provide for the staging load-on transient (applying different loads in sequence) 
so  that  the  FCPS  has  time  to  respond  and  provide  the  required  power  without  permanently 
damaging the system components and degrading performance. 

While load-off transient cannot be controlled in all circumstances, an FCPS typically responds and 
operates safely in open-circuit condition. 

4.4  MAINTENANCE AND RELIABILITY 

Since  the  RFCPS  is  a  closed  system,  the  anticipated  maintenance  activities  will  be  limited  to 
replacement of coolant filter, and potential water accumulation traps. 

In compliance with ASTM G93 and CGA G-4.1, an “oxygen clean” process must be observed 
while working on oxygen system-wetted components.  

• 

• 

ASTM G93, "Standard Practice for Cleaning Methods and Cleanliness Levels for Material 
and Equipment Used in Oxygen-Enriched Environments" 
CGA G-4.1, "Cleaning Equipment for Oxygen Service" 

The  system  stack  performance  shall  be  constantly  monitored.  It  can  isolate  collapsed  cells  to 
maintain the integrity of the system. 

4.5  CONCLUSION 

Due to the lack of  current market-driven motivation, the matured RFCPSes are limited to low-
power, high-cost space applications. As most systems are among currently operative technologies, 
the hazards have been addressed, including the HVDC system. 

New  safety  hazards  introduced  by  RFCPS  revolve  mainly  around  high-pressure  combustible 
hydrogen  gas  in  an  oxygen-enriched  environment,  and  materials  resistant  to  strong  oxidizer 
(oxygen).  Autoignition  of  hydrogen/oxygen  mixtures  need  to  be  evaluated  for  high-pressure 
electrolyzer failure modes. 

Packaging  high-pressure  hydrogen  and  oxygen  gases  inside  a  common  pressure  vessel  can  be 
disastrous. A breach of the separating barrier may lead to autoignition of the reactants and result 
in an explosion proportional to the amount of reactants at a stoichiometry of one. For this reason, 
a storage system with separately contained reactants may be required for the ability to shut off and 
isolate the reactants.

5.  NOTIONAL CONCEPT DESIGN – SOFCPS 

5.1  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION 

As indicated earlier in this report, the SOFCPS requires significant integration at the platform level 
to  achieve  plausibility.  The  FC  solutions  so  far  have  been  fairly  independent,  autonomously 
providing electric power. There is not much else to support a minimal operational requirement. 
The amount of power and duration for those systems is severely limited by the poor gravimetric 
efficiency  of  the  high-pressure  gaseous  storage  on  board,  and/or  the  extent  of  the  airport 
infrastructure developed to support all aircraft with gate power, and hydrogen refueling services. 
The  SOFCPS,  on  the  other  hand,  can  use  almost  any  ultra-low,  or  no-sulfur  hydrocarbon  fuel, 
many of which can be compatible with the aircraft MEs. They also demonstrate a gross thermal 
efficiency through combined heat and power beyond that of even the MEs. However, these systems 
are  handicapped  by  their  weight  and  operability,  and  will  also  require  a  different  concept  of 
operations than either of the PEM-based FC systems, or the conventional GT-powered start and 
APS. 

As envisioned, the SOFCPS is a hybridized power plant that efficiently recaptures chemical and 
thermodynamic  energy  from  within  the  SOFC  system  though  auxiliary  bottoming  cycles, 
providing low-quality heat to satisfy platform needs for cabin-related services, and fire prevention 
and control. This system potentially utilizes other devices for temporary energy storage in order to 
provide both a constant  base power capability, along with the ability to handle transient power 
demand. The power management is done in three tiers: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Base load — Provide constant and steady level of power that is slightly higher than the 
projected average power demand. This is provided by SOFC stack and GT generator. 
Load shaving — Capable of storing excess energy during low-demand periods and use it 
during peak-demand period. This is provided by high-specific power RFC. 
Transient — Provide short burst of energy during sharp demand transient state. This is 
provided by power batteries. 

SOFCPS is an integrated power system that provides multiple extended functions besides electrical 
power. It is idealized in the high-level schematic in Figure 19. Extended functions include: 

1. 

2. 
3. 
4. 
5.

As  indicated  in  Section  2.3.3.5      Preliminary  Assessment,  because  this  system  is  so  highly 
integrated  in  the  platform,  the  form  and  configuration  of  the  SOFCPS  will  have  a  number  of 
variations.  Total  weight  for  a  335  kW  rated  system  will  likely  be  over  7000  kg.  When 
implemented, much of this weight will be offset by legacy systems and components that it replaces.

5.3  NOTIONAL DESIGN 

The notional design of the SOFCPS is intended to be generic. The goal is to explore and expose 
new hazards introduced by the new technologies. 

The  design  of  any  system  is  an  iterative  process.  This  notional  design  presents  the  final 
representation as a result of these iterations. Efforts has been made to capture some of the rationale 
during the notional design process. 

5.3.1  System Description 

The SOFCPS is a hybrid power system that integrates many functions with its output streams for 
increased system efficiency and effectiveness. 

The  SOFCPS  comprises  several  subsystems  tightly  integrated  into  one  unit.  The  subsystems 
included are: fuel processing, fuel cell stack, catalytic burner, turbomachine, SG, stack cooling, 
condenser, and water separator (see Figure 20). 

5.3.1.1  Fuel Processing Subsystem 

The fuel processing subsystem  reforms  sulfur-free or ultra-low sulfur aviation fuel  into carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen enriched gaseous fuel for the stack through a catalytic steam reformer 
(CSR). The aviation fuel may be shared with the ME. The fuel pump delivers the low-sulfur fuel 

62 

 
 
 
 
to  the steam  reformer (SR) to  produce fuel  rich reformate. The simplified chemical  reaction is 
expressed in the following formula: 

C12H26 + 12H2O → 12CO + 25H2 

Both  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  are  fuel  to  SOFC.  This  endothermic  steam  reformation 
reaction takes place between 750°C and 950°C. Additional water is required to avoid coke or soot 
formation  on  catalyst.  The  additional  water  content  effectively  lowers  the  fuel  gases  partial 
pressure by 39 percent. 

The simplified chemical reaction is expressed in the following formula: 

C12H26 + 36H2O → 12CO + 25H2 + 24H2O 

This hot reformate mixture of CO, H2 and H2O is delivered to the fuel cell anode. 

5.3.1.2  SOFC Stack 

The SOFC stack takes the hydrogen-enriched gas from the steam reformer (SR) into its anode, and 
pressure-boosted air from the turbomachine’s compressor (CC) into its cathode. 

This exothermic reaction takes place between 750°C and 850°C. The pressures of the reactants are 
balanced and elevated to 60 psia. The reactants utilization rate is approximately 60 percent. Both 
operating pressure and utilization rate may be adjusted to  optimize the system  size and weight 
against overall efficiency.  

The SOFC stack is cooled with ambient air, which is then routed through cargo hold for heating, 
then fed into WIPS before exit into the environment. 

5.3.1.3  Catalytic Burner 

The stack exhaust gas streams from the anode and cathode are combined and fed into the catalytic 
burner (CB) to further extract power from the unused reactants. Part of the thermal power is used 
to sustain the endothermic SR reaction and drive the PT of the turbomachine. The selection of a 
CB is for maintaining a very highly efficient rich burner without concerns of lean blowout. The 
gas at the outlet with very low oxygen content at a fraction of a volumetric percent is ODA and 
may be used for fuel tank inerting or platform fire suppression. 

5.3.1.4  Turbomachine 

The hot CB exhaust is fed into the PT of the turbomachine and expanded to generate mechanical 
power to drive the stack CC, which is fed from the cabin air outflow and the electric generator 
(MG). The CC boosts the cabin air with a 4:1 ratio prior to feeding the fuel cell stack, increasing 
stack performance. Excess power from the PT is extracted through the MG. The output electrical 
power from the MG is fed into the 115VAC bus. 

63 

 
5.3.1.5  Steam Generator (SG) and Precooler 

The PT exhaust is routed through a steam generator (SG) to transfer the otherwise waste heat into 
generating steam for the catalytic steam reformer (CSR) and galley food heating. The SG is a two-
phase HEX. The hot  side receives turbine exhaust  gas and the  cold  side  receives the extracted 
water from downstream coolers, condenser, and water separator. The water vapor contained in the 
ODA is condensed in the hot side while the water is evaporated and superheated in the cold side 
of the SG.  

The hot  side gas is  further cooled by  cabin  outflow air in  the  pre-cooler  and finally chilled by 
ambient air to condense and separate the water content for CSR and galley use.  

5.3.1.6  Condenser/Water-Extractor 

The two-phase ODA/water is chilled by the very cold ambient ram air in the condenser to ensure 
sufficiently  dried  ODA  for  fuel  tank  inerting.  The  quality  of  the  ODA,  when  considering  total 
reaction from stack inlets to CB outlet, is expressed in the following formula: 

24CO + 50H2 + 48H2O + 37O2 + 185N2 → 24CO2 + 98H2O + 185N2 

When  the  ODA  is  chilled  to  freeze  point,  roughly  95  percent  of  the  water  is  condensed  and 
removed, based on 32°F steam pressure of 0.089 psia (ASHRAE steam table). The composition of 
the ODA is as follows: 

24CO2 + 5H2O + 185N2 

The condensed water is then pumped through the SG and the dried ODA is fed back through an 
economizer to recover some heat from the wet ODA to ensure no water droplet will enter the fuel 
tank. The dry exhaust is high-quality ODA, which is directed to FTIS. 

The steam condenses in galley heating and the condensate is fed into the water tank for lavatory 
service. When the galley heating is not in use, the steam is routed through a steam turbine (ST) to 
generate electricity for recharging the ESDs and condensing and reclaim the water for lavatory 
service. 

5.3.1.7  SOFC Stack Cooling Subsystem 

The superheated steam leaves the SR cold side and enters a cooling circuit in the SOFC stack to 
help cool it while elevating steam temperature ready for steam reformation process. Since the SR 
requires  about  50  percent  of  the  steam  for  the  reformation  process,  the  remaining  superheated 
steam can be piped to the galley for oven, then steam turbine, and finally lavatory water tank. 

The SOFC stack is cooled by three main streams: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

Cathode air — Balanced for stack reaction stoichiometry. 
Superheated steam — Higher heat content than air. 
Ambient (ram) air — May be used for cargo-hold heating via a radiator then heading to 
WIPS after leaving the stack.

5.3.1.8  Other Energy Supply Devices 

The SOFCPS is designed to provide a flat baseline loading power to support the aircraft systems. 
It needs to be hybridized with ESDs, such as RFCPS and batteries, to handle peak and transient 
loads, and regenerate/recharge when there is power surplus. 

5.3.2  System Configurations 

Due  to  the  large  amount  of  energy  storage  needed  for  this  hybrid  power  system,  RFCPS  is 
preferred over batteries. The prime location for RFCPS will be the tail cone to accommodate the 
size and shape of the reactant tanks. Batteries will be distributed where needed. 

There  are  many  ways  to  configure  the  hybridized,  integrated  SOFCPS.  The  three  system 
configurations are illustrated in Figure 21 through Figure 23 for the purpose of exploring hazards 
and implementation challenges. 

65 

 
 
5.3.2.1  Belly Mount 

The SOFCPS  is  highly integrated thermally; it would benefit if co-located with  ECS, which is 
traditionally located at the fuselage belly and wing root. This arrangement makes installation easy 
for its close proximity to the ECS air management, WIPS, fuel tank, and mid galley. 

Due to the nature of the SOFCPS, it should be situated inside the DFZ, which poses as a hazard 
for  the  closeness  to  the  fuel  tanks  and  the  cabin.  Figure  21  illustrates  the  notional  installation 
location. 

Figure 21. SOFCPS configuration option #1 

5.3.2.2  Empennage Mount 

The SOFCPS may be installed at the root of the vertical stabilizer, as shown in Figure 22. This 
location is relatively safe as it has been used to mount the ME for some aircraft. The services it 
provided such as FTIS and WIPS are ineffective and would not trade well with other installation 
options. 

66 

 
 
Figure 22. SOFCPS configuration option #2 

5.3.2.3  Wing-Root Leading Edge Mount 

The third option is to have two half-sized SOFCPSes situated at the leading edge (LE) of the wing 
root,  as  shown  in  Figure  23.  This  option  allows  easy  thermal  integration  while  at  a  safe  and 
accessible location outside of the fuselage enclosure. 

Figure 23. SOFCPS configuration option #3 

67 

 
 
 
5.3.3  Subsystem Notional Designs 

The  implementation  of  such  a  hybridized  and  highly  integrated  power  system  presents  endless 
design choices and optimization strategies. This notional design presents one which touches on 
many aspects of possible configurations. 

The thermally integrated main SOFCPS will be packaged similarly as a GT APU with more output 
fluid streams such as high temperature steam and ODA lines. 

5.3.3.1  SOFC Stack 

Due  to  the  stack’s  brittleness,  high-temperature  seal-material  limitations,  elevated  operating 
temperature,  and pressure condition,  the stack shall be in  a cylindrical  shape inside the system 
pressure vessel. The stack’s thermal management (cooling) is the greatest challenge, though the 
system mass and thermal balance calculations assume the cooling challenge is overcome. 

5.3.3.2  Catalytic Steam Reformer 

While the endothermic steam reformation reaction operates at a temperature slightly lower than 
that of the stack, it shall be concentrically arranged around the stack for better thermal integration. 
Both steam and fuel are premixed and preheated by the waste heat from the stack and act as part 
of the stack cooling sink. 

5.3.3.3  Catalytic Burner 

This  exothermic  reaction  shall  also  be  arranged  concentrically  around  the  SR  to  maintain  its 
temperature. 

5.3.3.4  Turbomachine 

The  PT  inlet  of  the  turbomachine  is  close  coupled  with  the  CB  exhaust.  The  turbomachine 
resembles  a  small  traditional  GT  APU.  The  turbomachine  output  power  will  be  affected  by 
altitude, unlike the stack that generates constant power, with same reactants flow conditions. 

5.3.3.5  Steam Generator 

SG is a two-phase HEX with water/steam on the cold side, while the hot exhaust ODA from the 
power turbine on the hot side. 

5.3.3.6  Condenser/Water Extractor 

The cooled ODA is fed through a series of HEXs to further cool to ~70°F by cabin outflow air and 
to dried ODA before it enters the ambient air-cooled condenser. 

Special care must be taken into the design to avoid ice formation inside the condenser since the 
sink temperature is subfreezing. 

68 

 
Water condensate will be extracted and pumped through the SG. The dried ODA, with ~95 percent 
of the water removed, is sent through the wet ODA HEX to ensure it is droplet-free before entering 
the fuel tank for inerting. 

5.3.3.7  Cargo-Hold Heating Radiator and WIPS 

The  stack  cooling  air  is  ducted  through  a  radiator  located  inside  the  cargo  hold  to  maintain 
temperature for cargos. The hot air leaving the radiator is finally sent to the LE of the wings for 
full time icing protection. 

5.3.3.8  RFCPS 

Section 4.3.1   discusses the RFCPS. 

5.3.3.9  Electric Power System 

Figure  24  is  the  top-level  electrical  system  architecture  for  this  notional  SOFCPS-equipped 
aircraft. 

Figure 24. Top-level electrical system architecture – Hybrid SOFCPS 

5.3.3.9.1  High Voltage DC Switching and Protection 

High-voltage  DC  primary  power  distribution  contactors  are  heavier  and  more  expensive  than 
traditional AC contactors to withstand switch contact arcing. Ideally, they need to be high-power 

69 

 
 
SSPC  modules  to  provide  fast  switching  since  the  pass-through  fault  energy  before  an 
electromechanical contactor opens (typically a 20-30mS period) and can cause significant arcing. 
This effect is much less pronounced in AC systems because the arc self-extinguishes during zero-
crossing.  Such  high  power  SSPCs  are  not  commercially  available.  As  in  current  SSPC-based 
secondary  distribution  systems,  fail-short  protection  must  be  included  and  must  prevent  the 
charging  of  load  capacitance  by  leakage  current  (which  is  particularly  important  for  personnel 
safety in these high-voltage systems). SSPCs must be lightning-immune and need to be able to 
withstand or control load capacitive inrush currents. 

Arc fault detection/protection is an important feature in high-voltage DC systems. It needs to be 
able  to  detect  different  arc  types  and  minimize  false  trips  due  to  transients  and  normal  loads. 
Protection level co-ordination is required to ensure only the furthest downstream protection device 
is activated. 

Corona/partial discharge are important considerations in high-voltage systems. The choice of +/-
270VDC allows standard insulation systems and design practices to be used. 

5.3.3.9.2  Power Quality Including Transient Response 

While 270VDC systems have been used for several years in some military fighter jet applications, 
use of high voltage DC in commercial air transport has been limited, and where used, it typically 
has been locally distributed and used for a few specific loads. 

Power quality, including transient response, is an important consideration. In particular, transient 
response of a FCPS needs to be carefully considered to avoid excessive voltage excursions. This 
may necessitate including energy storage (batteries) as part of the FCPS. The FCPS output may 
need to be fed to the bus via a DC-DC converter to enable sufficient voltage control and energy-
storage  power  management.  This  DC-DC  converter  could  also  provide  power  control/current 
limiting  (by  reducing  the  supplied  steady-state  voltage),  but  this  is  not  effective  with  constant 
power loads. 

Load  limiting  (load-shedding)  would  be  required  to  prevent  FCPS  overload.  It  also  is 
recommended  that  the  distribution  system  provides  for  the  staging  load-on  transient  (applying 
different loads in sequence) so that the FCPS has time to respond and provide the required power 
without permanently damaging the system components and degrading performance. 

While load-off transient cannot be controlled in all circumstances, an FCPS typically responds and 
operates safely in open-circuit condition. 

5.4  MAINTENANCE AND RELIABILITY 

The  SOFCPS  is  a  sophisticated  system  that  ducts  high-pressure  reactive  gas.  It  includes  high-
temperature  chemical  reaction  chambers,  sensitive  ceramic  or  metal/ceramic  hybrid  structures, 
catalytic  materials,  high-speed  turbomachinery,  high-power,  high-voltage  electrical  feeds,  and 
devices  for  power  conditioning  and  control.  Given  that  this  system  is  intended  to  operate 
continuously, while the aircraft is on the ground and in all phases of flight, means that during the 
expected life of the aircraft, this system will accumulate an unprecedented number of hours. The 
critical  failure  of  a  component  in  this  system  is  inevitable.  How  that  failure  affects  the  safe 

70 

 
operation of the system and the aircraft it is installed in is driven by careful design of the system, 
and the implementation of appropriate measures and features that manage this risk to an acceptable 
level. Demonstration of appropriate reliability and system robustness will be key, as it is with any 
other critical aircraft subsystem.  

Many of the components in this system are similar-to components and equipment currently used 
on  commercial  air  transport  aircraft.  As  such,  there  are  existing  methods  for  reliable  design, 
manufacture, and qualification, including the electrical power and distribution system and the fuel 
delivery system. The system HEXs and turbomachinery also share a heritage with existing aircraft 
system  technology.  Their  reliability  should  be  within  existing  design  capability  and  the 
maintenance of these systems consistent with current practices. 

Unique is the implementation of a FC stack necessarily constructed with brittle materials that could 
leak reactive gases into the compartment, or fail to function during critical periods of flight, for 
which there are few mature reliability models that would apply. Reputedly, these systems have 
shown very long lives in stationary earthbound applications. It remains to be seen how reliably 
they perform in the air. While the stack core is likely not serviceable, there may be a design need 
that allows repair, or replacement of external seals, and system components. Since the stack itself 
is somewhat fragile and  cycle-limited there should be appropriate maintainability built into the 
system to allow economical and safe removal and replacement. As the studied system weighs 7000 
kg, the bulk of which is the stack, this could be a significant undertaking. 

There  is  no  question  that  the  appropriate  health  monitoring  with  effective  prognostics  that  can 
measure the progressive degradation of key aspects of the system-critical components can provide 
early warning of the most critical or most common failures. It is a rare argument, however, that 
health monitoring by itself improves system reliability, unless there is an adaptive feature in this 
system that enables it to change modes, and provide limited or reduced, but still sufficient operative 
capability during the worst-failure scenarios. 

In any case, all of the components’ critical failure modes must be understood. Also, the system 
design,  which  includes  build  quality,  as  well  as  operational  monitoring  and  analytics,  must  be 
configured  to  predict,  avoid,  and  where  required,  safely  operate  with  one  or  several  key 
components that are not operational or degraded in some way. 

5.5  CONCLUSION 

The functionalities of the all-time SOFCPS, which appears attractive in a notional design for its 
higher  efficiency,  reduced  emission,  reduced  noise,  and  uninterrupted  and  independent  power 
supply, encourages a new, uncompromised, and thrust-only ME design. It also allows the airplane 
to be parked away from the terminal in overcongested or undersized airports around the world. 

The  NCD  of  the  SOFCPS  performance  is  based  on  extreme  optimism  in  its  technology 
development and design. The goal is to expose broader areas of implementation possibilities for 
safety-hazard assessment. 

The  equipment  replaced  by  the  system  potentially  includes  GT  APU,  S/Gs,  motors  and  motor 
controllers, RAT, air separation module, potable water and reduced water tank size, all of which 
will be credited for specific design trade.

The implementation of the notionally designed SOFCPS is contingent upon the paradigm shift in 
the  aerospace  industry  in  determining  functions and  load  management  with  technology.  It  also 
requires a clean-slate platform design opportunity usually driven by business rationale, but which 
happens infrequently. 

The  reliability  of  this  system  is  impacted  by  its  size,  and  concept  of  operations.  Although 
implementation  of  trending  analytics  can  help  determine  dispatch  reliability  and  avoid  failure 
during  critical  operation  modes,  it  is  dependent  on  the  development  and  recognition  of  critical 
failure modes in this system, including the stack, and developing effective sensors and models that 
can identify and track progressive structural and performance deterioration.  

The greatest caveat of all is the availability of sulfur-free or ultra-low sulfur fuel to support the 
SOFCPS technology implementation. 

6.  NEW SAFETY HAZARDS ASSESSMENT 

With  each  implementation  of  new  technology,  it  brings  along  new  safety  hazards  whether  in 
system performance, operation, or maintenance. Unlike GA APU, FCPS comes in vast numbers 
of  combinations  between  fuel  type,  fuel  state,  fuel  processing,  stack  chemistry,  operating 
conditions, and services. 

Also,  unlike  the  GT  APU,  FCPS  provides  fertile  ground  for  various  degrees  of  hybridization 
between air-breathing FC,  turbomachines, self-contained reactants  fuel  cell, batteries, and even 
super capacitors, each tailored to its strength as subsystems. The focus of assessing safety hazards 
shift from specific design to categories of behaviors. 

Hybridized  power  systems  add  one  more  layer  of  safety  hazards  due  to  the  interdependency 
between  sub-systems,  which  is  difficult  to  assess  categorically  and  should  be  dealt  with 
independently for each specific design. To this end, the aim of this study was shifted more toward 
exploring multiple implementations to expose more categories of safety hazards than any well-
defined specific notional design. 

As the notional design progresses in discovering new hazard categories, it becomes apparent that 
the hazard categories contained in each of the three selected FC technologies are hierarchical. That 
is, most of the safety hazards involved in direct hydrogen PEMFCPS are also inherent in RFCPS. 
Likewise, all the safety hazards involved in RFCPS are also inherent in SOFCPS implementation 
because of the inclusivity of RFCPS. By understanding the safety hazards of SOFCPS, the other 
FCPSes are automatically covered. 

A summary of consolidated new safety hazard categories for FCPS is covered in the following 
sections. 

6.1  BATTERIES  

The aviation power/energy batteries have been vigorously studied and certification requirement is 
well developed. 

72 

 
6.2  GT 

The GT APU certification requirement is mature and well-defined in TSO-C77b. 

6.3  PEMFCPS 

The safety standards for PEMFCPS are also well defined by the automotive industry, which may 
be adapted readily. 

6.4  RFCPS 

This  self-contained  power  system  places  energy-dense  fuel  and  strong  oxidizer  in  very  close 
proximity at very high pressure. The new safety hazards categories in this system include: 

• 

• 
• 
• 

System component cleanliness for strong oxidizer. “Oxygen-clean” procedure must be 
followed rigorously during installation and maintenance periods. 
Elevated fire and explosion potential in oxygen-enriched environment. 
Hydrogen/oxygen autoignition condition in high-pressure reactants gas system. 
Fire potential for surrounding flammable materials. 

6.5  HYBRIDIZED SOFCPS 

As suggested in SOFCPS NCD, the implementation is unlikely without the integration of all forms 
of powers and hybridization of other power sub-system such as GT, RFCPS, and batteries. The 
new safety hazards should be analyzed by fluid circuits and hardware. 

6.5.1  Hazard from Each Circuit 

6.5.1.1  Superheated Steam 

• 
• 
•

Icing (blockage) and collapsing — Vacuum created by steam condensing 

6.5.1.2  Stack Cooling Air 

• 
• 

Cargo hold heating (liquid cooled) — Radiator leak proofing 
Wing icing protection (air cooled) — High-temperature over fuel tanks 

6.5.1.3  Oxygen Depleted Air

6.6  DESIGNATED FIRE ZONE 

The  area  enclosing  turbomachine  and  steam  reformer  should  be  considered  a  DFZ  because 
turbomachine resembles a GT APU, and the SR operates at a very high temperature with liquid jet 
fuel. 

6.7  FUEL TANK (WATER) CONTAMINATION 

The ODA supplied is slightly undersaturated at free point. It could be absorbed by warm fuel or 
form tiny ice crystals in cold fuel. Current fuel is exposed to saturated ambient air in airport fuel 
farms, the condition of which is no better than the blanketed aircraft fuel tank. 

6.8  PREVENTION 

• 
• 
• 

Isolate energy source from power generation device, isolate between reactants 
Ventilate (passive) to disperse leaked reactants 
Channeling and directing released energy in case of explosion

• 

Health monitoring on key system components 

These assessments are incorporated into the RTSG. 

7.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 

7.1  CONCLUSION 

The safe implementation of three FCPS technologies to provide auxiliary power for commercial 
air transport aircraft  was  evaluated. The goal is  to reveal  new safety hazards introduced to the 
aircraft by new technologies. 

Unlike the GT  auxiliary  power unit (APU) that it replaces in  this study,  the FCPS comes with 
many forms of stack chemistry that require different types and forms of fuel operating at different 
conditions. It is physically improbable that FCPS could replace the full functionality of the GT 
APU in a modern aircraft without a major modification to the aircraft. To accept FCPS as a viable 
auxiliary power solution, the system architecture paradigm of the aircraft power needs change.  

For each FCPS to be technologically feasible, reasonable and technically achievable assumptions 
were made in this study. (The study approach is set to explore when, not if, some feasible FCPS 
can replace GT APU functions, and assess the new safety hazards brought to the aircraft through 
these technologies.) Three probable FCPS types were examined. The safety hazards nested with 
the SOFCPS have been all-inclusive (that is, once the study is done on SOFCPS, it also should 
cover RFCPS and PEMFCPS). 

For  direct  hydrogen  PEMFCPS,  an  implementation  with  minimally  critical  functionality  was 
assumed and compared  with  a GT APU to  determine that it could  be plausible. As PEMFCPS 
technology  is  matured  from  automotive  applications,  all  learning  from  automotive  FCPS 
implementation will be of great value. The obstacle for adapting this technology lies in the lack of 
hydrogen-refilling infrastructure in all airports. 

Although  RFCPS  is  independent  of  hydrogen  distribution  infrastructure,  the  maturity  of  this 
technology for aviation is low. The added pressurized oxygen as a strong oxidizer increases safety 
risk  for  providing  an  oxygen-enriched  environment,  as  well  as  reactants  system  cleanliness 
requirement and autoignition potential. 

To be a viable alternative, SOFC with reformed jet fuel needs extensive platform integration with 
a pressure-boosting turbomachine and hybridization with RFCPS and/or batteries. The magnitude 
of a system architecture change demands a paradigm shift in design philosophy, requiring a clean-
sheet design opportunity. 

Overall, most safety hazards are covered in the final report of the FAA ESD aviation rulemaking 
committee. Few additional safety hazards identified in the study will be documented in RTSG: 

a. 
b. 

RFCPS — Hydrogen autoignition potential in high-pressure reactants system 
SOFCPS — Superheated steam system and galley appliances
