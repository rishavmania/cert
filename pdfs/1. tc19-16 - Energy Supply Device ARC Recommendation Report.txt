Executive Summary 

This report contains the findings and recommendations of the Energy Supply Device Aviation 
Rulemaking Committee (ESD ARC).  The ESD ARC (the Committee) was charted by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) on April 15, 2015 to provide recommendations that may be used 
to develop appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance material for energy supply device 
installations on transport airplanes and other types of aircraft, with a focus on hydrogen fuel 
cells. 

Hydrogen fuel cells1 are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy of a fuel 
(typically hydrogen) and an oxidant (oxygen) directly into electrical energy.  This electrical 
energy can then be conditioned and used for multiple purposes.  Below is a typical simplified 
fuel cell (FC) diagram.  Each fuel cell produces approximately 0.6 volts of direct current.  Placing 
each individual fuel cell with other individual fuel cells makes a fuel cell stack and this increases 
the amount of voltage produced.  The more fuel cells in a stack, the higher the voltage output.  
The surface area of each individual cell controls the amount of current (i.e., amperage) 
available.  Larger surface area equal higher current levels.  A mock-up of a 46-cell fuel cell stack 
is shown in Figure 2.  The reactants, product water and cooling water are fed though the 
manifold fittings on the end.  Current is tapped off the two tabs just under the end plates.

Fuel cells have become increasingly important as alternative sources of power, offering the 
potential for a reduction in emissions in particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon 
dioxide.  In addition, they offer quieter operation than a combustion engine, more efficient use 
of the fuel energy compared to combustion engines, and offer more flexible energy storage 
density compared to batteries.  Apart from emissions reduction and thermal efficiency, fuel cell 
technology can constitute distributed power systems; enabling locating the power near the 
point of use and also reducing the power draw from the engines.  The main by-products of a 
fuel cell are water and heat.  Both of these by-products can be discarded; however, they also 
have the potential to provide potable water and heat for use by other airplane systems.  
Another by-product is oxygen depleted air that could be used for fuel tank inerting.  Thus, 
potentially negating the need for a nitrogen inerting system. 

The main body of the report summarizes the findings and recommendations of the committee.  
Details of those findings and recommendations are contained in the report’s appendices.  The 
appendices are presented in a logical order that begins with a comparison of fuel cells with 
other energy supply devices technologies.  It discusses fuel cell benefits and compares FCs to 
batteries and combustion systems.  The appendices then progress by presenting various FC 
technology options (i.e., different types of FCs), and then focuses on the technology options 
that are best suited for use in an aviation environment.  Next is a discussion about all of the 
components that are required to enable the FC to produce electricity, deliver it to a load (e.g., 
galley power), and dispose of the by-products.  The FC itself, along with these components, 

iv 

 
comprise a fuel cell system (FCS).  A detailed discussion of the FCS is presented, as is a 
discussion of various sources and storage options for hydrogen and oxygen.  For example, pure 
hydrogen can be stored in various forms, including a pressurized gaseous state.  However, it can 
also be derived from jet fuel through a process known as reforming.  Various reforming 
methods are discussed as well. 

Then airborne applications for fuel cells are discussed.  Applications discussed are galley power, 
stand-alone power, medivac system power, auxiliary power, emergency power systems, and 
unmanned aerial system propulsion.  These applications are the ones most likely to take 
advantage of the benefits that a fuel cell can offer using today’s fuel cell technology. The 
installation and use of a FCS for one of these applications requires some level of integration 
with other airplane systems. While some FC applications will require minimal modifications to 
install (e.g., self-contained medevac), others will require extensive modifications (e.g., 
emergency power system, auxiliary power).  A discussion of fuel cell integration with aircraft 
systems is therefore provided in the application appendix as well. 

Following the applications discussion, fuel cell systems hazards are discussed.  Fuel cell use as a 
source of power is becoming more common for ground based solutions.  As examples; fuel cell 
powered forklifts are used in warehouses, fuel cell powered city busses are in use many 
countries, and Toyota sells a fuel cell powered passenger sedan.  However, fuel cell use in 
airborne applications is in its infancy (the exception is the use of fuel cells in NASA’s Gemini and 
Space Shuttle programs).  While hazards associated with hydrogen, whether used in ground 
based or in airborne applications, might not be new in themselves, they are not currently well 
addressed in the airworthiness requirements.  Use in an airborne environment demands that 
potential hazards associated with fuel cell systems be fully understood.  Therefore, the hazards 
appendix discusses a multitude of potential hazards and their mitigation means.  This includes 
hydrogen fire and explosion hazards, mechanical and material hazards, physiological hazards, 
cryogenic hazards, non-hydrogen fuel and oxygen hazards, and electrical hazards. 

Following the discussion on hazards, the next appendix presents recommendations for 
regulatory standards and advisory material.  After developing the information on various types 
of fuel cell technologies, their possible aircraft applications, their potential hazards, and the 
review of existing part 25 and operational regulatory requirements, it was decided to: 1) 
recommend the development of one new part 25 regulation, known as the fuel cell system 
safety baseline regulation; 2) recommend revisions to existing part 25 regulatory standards to 
accommodate fuel cell systems; 3) identify existing part 25 regulations that are applicable to 
fuel cell systems, but do not require any revision; and 4) identify operational regulations in 
parts 43, 91, 121, 125, and 129 that are applicable to fuel cell systems.  With the exception of 
the operational requirements, the recommendations apply to both 14 CFR part 25 and EASA’s 
CS 25.  Any differences between the two sets of standards is noted in the recommendation’s 
appendix. 

Although the committee does not provide recommendations for regulatory requirements for 
CFR / CS parts 23, 27, and 29 airworthiness standards, the same concerns would apply with the 
typical differences between the different product types. The committee therefore recommends 

v 

when a rulemaking group is created, this group will amend the different airworthiness 
standards based on the conclusions presented in this report. 

Also included in the recommendation’s appendix is a recommendation for more general 
regulation that would be applicable to most any type of energy storage device, independent of 
technology.  The regulation would replace the existing 14 CFR § 25.1353(b) / EASA CS 
25.1353(c).  This regulation currently contains requirements for storage batteries, but does not 
contain adequate requirements for lithium based batteries or other types of ESDs, such as fuel 
cells or supercapacitors.  Therefore, in the case of lithium batteries, the FAA, EASA, and other 
authorities must issue special conditions that are in lieu of the requirements contained in § 
25.1353(b) / 25.1353(c).  The recommended regulation is more performance based with the 
aim of avoiding the need to issue special conditions or change it every time new ESD 
technologies are introduced in the aircraft. 

Although the Committee did not develop advisory material in the form of an advisory circular.  
The committee recommends that the data contained in Appendices A through G be used as the 
basis for advisory circular should the FAA/EASA adopt the recommendations to develop a part 
25 fuel cell system safety baseline regulation.  It should also use this report’s data to update 
advisory circulars and policy associated with the existing regulations that have been identified 
as needing revisions to accommodate fuel cell systems. 

In summary, the Committee is recommending the development of new and revised 14 CFR part 
25 and EASA CS 25 airworthiness standards: 

•  One new regulation dedicated to fuel cell system safety is proposed.  

o 

 1 new regulation proposed:  § 25.XXXX Fuel Cell System Safety 

•  One performance based regulation is proposed to help cover ESDs, known and new-to-

come unknown ones. 

o 

 Complete overhaul of the existing 14 CFR § 25.1353(b) / EASA CS 25.1353(c) 

•  20 proposed changes to existing Part 25 / CS 25 regulations to address fuel cell systems  

•  67 identified Part 25 / CS 25 regulations to be applicable to FCSs in their current wording 

•  71 identified Parts 43, 91, 121, 125, and 129 regulations applicable to FCSs in their current 

wording

  OVERVIEW 

Hydrogen fuel cells2 are a maturing technology that may have valuable application to transport 
and other type of aircraft. Fuel cells (FCs) may provide benefits and savings as compared to 
traditional battery and combustion energy systems as it relates to weight, safety, maintenance, 
cost, reliability, volume, noise signature, thermal signature, efficiency, CO2 reduction, air 
pollution, and others. However, any one or combination of these benefits must be evaluated 
with respect to a specific application or combinations of applications to realize their potential in 
a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner. Appendix A of this report presents a comparison of 
FCs with other technologies such as batteries, capacitors, and combustion engines. 

This report is about the technology and safety issues of various types of FCs.  It is also about the 
identification of the need to develop new and revised regulatory standards to ensure their safe 
design, installation, and operation.  The report also identifies existing regulatory standards that 
are applicable to FCs without the need for revision. 

Six different FC types are discussed, and their characteristics, such as typical power capacity, 
electric efficiency, potential application use, and the advantages and challenges are compared.  
This discussion is located in in Appendix B.  The six types of FCs discussed in appendix B are: 

•  Direct-Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) 

•  Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) 

•  Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC) 

•  Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) 

•  Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) 

•  Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) 

Two of these types have the most potential for use in modern transport airplanes and other 
types of aircraft.  These two types; proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and solid 
oxide fuel cells (SOFC), are examined in detail in Appendix C.  Therefore, the recommendations 
for regulatory standards are based on these two types.  Although the standards could easily be 
adopted to address the other fuel cell technologies discussed in Appendix B. 

Fuel cells need a source of hydrogen (H2) in order to function.  The source of H2 is, to a large 
extent, application dependent.  Sources of H2 can include H2 stored as a liquid, as a gas, or in a 
solid.  Other sources of H2 include light hydrocarbons, solid fuels, fuel reforming, and 
electrolysis.  Appendix D provides a detailed narrative about sources and storage of H2.  
Appendix D also discusses sources of oxygen (O2) that is used by the FC as an oxidant. An 

2 “Hydrogen fuel cells” in this report are herein afterwards referred to as “fuel cells.” 

19 

                                                      
oxidant is necessary to recombine with the negative and positive H2 ions to form one of the by-
products of a FC: water.  Together, H2 and O2 are known as reactants. 

Fuel cells have the potential to be used in multiple airborne applications.  These applications 
can range from a source of emergency electrical energy that replaces the traditional ram air 
turbine (RAT), providing galley power, and act as a replacement for today’s auxiliary power unit 
(APU).  Several applications for using FCs on transport airplanes and unmanned aircraft systems 
(UAS) are discussed in detailed in Appendix E. 

Fuel cells have the potential to introduce multiple hazards once installed aboard an aircraft.  
Some of these are the same as other systems already in use today, and some are unique due to 
the technology behind FCs.  These hazards are summarized in Section 4 and are discussed in 
detail in Appendix F. 

Recommendations for new and revised 14 CFR part 25 regulatory standards that can be applied 
to the design and installation of fuel cell systems are presented in Appendix G.  The report also 
identifies existing part 25 regulatory standards that can be applied to fuel cell system 
certification without needing revision.  Material that may be used to develop advisory material 
is also presented.  Section 5 contains a summary of these recommendations, and they are 
discussed in detail in Appendix G. The Energy Supply Device Aviation Rulemaking Committee’s 
(ESD ARC) charter, (Appendix J), specifies that: “FAA airworthiness standards should be written 
to be performance-based and should address all foreseeable energy supply device types to the 
greatest extent possible.”  Therefore, the development of a performance based regulation that 
is applicable to all ESDs is recommended to replace the current 14 CFR § 25.1353(b) or EASA CS  
25.1353(c). This is in addition to fuel cell system specific regulatory recommendations given in 
this report. 

  WHAT IS A FUEL CELL? 

Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy of a fuel and oxidant 
(usually hydrogen and oxygen) directly into electrical energy.  This electrical energy can then be 
conditioned and used for multiple purposes.  A simplified diagram of a single cell in a fuel cell 
stack is shown in Figure 3. 

20 

Figure 3. Simplified Fuel Cell Diagram (Typical) 

Figure 4 shows a more detailed cell description of one type of fuel cell: proton exchange 
membrane.  It depicts how the fuel and oxidizer is delivered to a cell and where the 
electrochemical reaction at the catalyst takes place to produce electrical energy. 

Figure 4. A Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Block Diagram 

21 

 
 
Each fuel cell produces approximately 0.6 volts of direct current.  Placing each individual fuel 
cell with other individual fuel cells makes a fuel cell stack and this increases the amount of 
voltage produced.  The more fuel cells in a stack, the higher the voltage output.  The surface 
area of each individual cell controls the amount of current (i.e., amperage) available.  Larger 
surface area equal higher current levels.  A mock-up of a 46-cell fuel cell stack is shown in 
Figure 5.  The reactants, product water and cooling water are fed though the manifold fittings 
on the end plate.  Current is tapped off the two tabs just under the end plates. 

Figure 5. Mock-Up of a Fuel Cell Stack Composed of 46 Individual Fuel Cells 

2.1  FUEL CELL SYSTEM 

While it is the fuel cell assembled into a fuel cell stack itself that produces electricity, to do so 
requires other components.  Fuel and oxidant must be supplied to the FC stack, it must be 
monitored and controlled, and it must be thermally managed.  A fuel cell stack also produces 
by-products such as water and heat that must be dealt with. Its electrical power output may 
require conditioning so that it supplies the type of power its load requires. 

22 

 
A fuel cell system (FCS) is defined as follows: 

Those units and components using an electrochemical conversion 
process to produce electricity from a fuel and an oxidant.  This includes 
reactants and reaction products, steam reformers, supply and exhaust 
devices, enclosures, fuel cell stacks, electric power output devices, 
cooling and heating devices and a centralized control and monitoring 
subsystem. 

Figure 6 is a block diagram that depicts the various components of a FCS. A detailed description 
of each component of a FCS is given in Appendix C, section C.2. 

Figure 6. Fuel Cell System 

  AIRBORNE APPLICATIONS FOR FUEL CELL SYSTEMS 

Fuel cells have the potential to be used in many different applications on aircraft.  These can 
range from non-integrated applications such as medical equipment/systems, through 
integrated non-power applications to non-essential and essential systems, galleys, and 
navigation. The FC technologies for these applications are at various stages of technical 
maturity, but in general most systems are still in development and not yet a true commercially 
ready product for use in aviation.  Nonetheless, there is growing interest in looking at how FCs 
can enable new benefits and functionality relative to state of the art systems on the aircraft. 

23 

 
3.1  POSSIBLE AIRBORNE APPLICATIONS 

To better understand how a FCS could be used on an aircraft the following uses for a FCS are 
discussed in detail in Appendix E: 

•  Galley power 

•  Stand-alone power / Medevac 

•  Auxiliary power 

•  Emergency power 

•  Unmanned aerial system propulsion 

Several of these applications are illustrated in Figure 7. 

Figure 7. Potential Fuel Cell Application on Aircraft 

3.2  FUEL CELL INTEGRATION WITH AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS 

This range of applications involves some level of integration with aircraft systems.  On one end 
of the spectrum of applications, a FCS may, for instance, generate a small amount of 

24 

 
supplemental electrical power to a dedicated payload onboard the aircraft independent of the 
aircraft electrical power sources.  Thus, requiring small modifications to the aircrafts electrical 
architecture.  On the other end of the spectrum, a FCS may be used to provide primary 
electrical power, supply water, or inerting gas to the aircraft while operating in a highly 
integrated manner with other aircraft systems.  This would require major modifications to the 
aircraft.  The lower levels of integration may be the easiest point of entry for introducing FCs in 
an aircraft, requiring less modification to the aircraft design or operation and fewer safety 
implications. 

This report does not attempt to describe all the possible applications that FCs could be used for 
onboard an aircraft.  Rather, the purpose of the applications that are discussed is to describe 
and classify them in such a way that any application may be filled by potentially a range of FCS 
technologies.  In Appendix E, the applications are described as they appear from the aircraft 
view point and the type of functions that they are required to provide.  This includes the 
expected benefits that they bring to the aircraft and how they integrate into the platform.  
Therefore, the key metrics differentiating the applications must be defined from the point of 
view of the aircraft, and not in terms of technology variants. 

  FUEL CELL HAZARDS 

While fuel cells offer many benefits, they also can introduce hazards that must be addressed.  
The committee has identified the types of hazards commonly associated with the design, 
installation, and operation of fuel cells. This section summarizes those hazards.  A detailed 
discussion of the hazards is contained in Appendix F. 

4.1 

INTRODUCTION 

Hazards consideration should be made in accordance with SAE ARP 4754, Guidelines for 
Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems, and ARP 4761/ED 79, Guidelines and Methods for 
Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment.  This 
identifies design hazards as well as interface requirements to other systems as installation risks.  
Based on the criticality of the system/sub-system, the related design assurance level should be 
determined according to ARP 4754, and the hazards need to be analyzed in accordance with 
ARP 4761. As oxygen and H2 have specific hazards, design consideration should be extended by 
a dedicated oxygen-hazard and H2-hazard analysis. These analyses should consider specific 
design hazards for all sub-systems (i.e., oxygen, H2, fuel cell stack, pressure vessels, etc.) 
including system integration into the aircraft environment. 

The location the FCS installation in the aircraft can greatly affect the hazard mitigation 
approaches. Hydrogen currently is not used as a fuel in civil aviation. The predominant and 
most feared hazard that can be created by H2 is fire or explosion.  As discussed in Appendix D, 
H2 can be stored as a pressurized gas.  The aviation community has significant experience with 
compressed gas in the form of oxygen, which is well covered in today’s regulations.  Similar 

25 

hazard mitigation principles can therefore be applied with specific care to ensure that the 
fire/explosion risk of H2 is properly managed. 

The minimum ignition energy (MIE) for a wide range of H2 concentrations in air or oxygen is 
very low. The MIE varies over the flammable range of hydrogen-air mixtures; for the most 
ignitable mixture, the MIE is 0.017 mJ.  Therefore, in contrast to traditional fuel-air mixtures, 
the avoidance of a dedicated ignition source will not be sufficient to mitigate the fire risk. The 
only feasible method to extinguish a H2 fire is to stop the supply of H2.  Traditional 
extinguishing methods will not suffice.  Figure 8 depicts the MIE at stoichiometric conditions.  
This figure shows that the MIE of H2 is 10 times less than jet fuel. 

However, unlike traditional aircraft fuel tanks, a pressurized gaseous H2 tank will not contain a 
fuel air mixture, but rather pure H2.  The lack of air, or oxygen, ensures that the compressed gas 
within the hydrogen tank is not flammable provided it is properly filled.  As a result, the primary 
design methods to prevent H2 fire hazards are the separation of H2 and any oxidizer, 
preventing the accumulation of flammable mixtures and ensuring effective H2 detection and 
shut-off means as last line of defense. 

Figure 8. Minimum Ignition Energy at Stoichiometric Conditions

  REGULATORY STANDARDS AND ADVISORY MATERIAL 

This section summarizes the recommended regulatory approach for new, revised, and existing 
regulatory standards applicable to the certification of a FCS on transport category airplanes.  It 
also contains a discussion on the material that needs to be developed for advisory material.  
The recommendations for new, revised, and applicable existing regulations are discussed in 
detail in Appendix G. 

5.1  DEVELOPMENT OF A FUEL CELL SYSTEM SAFETY BASELINE REGULATION 

After developing the information on various types of fuel cell technologies, their possible 
aircraft applications, their potential hazards, and the review of existing part 25 regulatory 
requirements, it was decided that a new regulation, known as the baseline regulation, should 
be developed.  The baseline regulation recommendation contains the elements necessary to 

28 

address the unique safety issues associated with the design and installation of a hydrogen FCS 
on board a transport airplane. While the baseline rule is presented as a regulation, the 
Committee understands that it will most likely need revision to accommodate the FAA’s and 
other airworthiness authority’s regulatory language requirements. 

Following the discussion of the baseline regulation in Appendix G, section G.4.2 provides a link 
between the hazards discussed in Appendix F and each subsection of the FCS baseline 
regulation. 

Here is the recommended baseline regulation (located here in Appendix G): 

25.XXX Fuel Cell System Safety 

a)  For the purposes of this chapter, a fuel cell system is defined as: Those units and 

components using an electrochemical conversion process to produce electricity from 
a fuel and an oxidant. This includes reactants and reaction products, steam 
reformers, supply and exhaust devices, enclosures, fuel cell stacks, electric power 
output devices, cooling and heating devices, and control and monitoring subsystem. 

For the purposes of this chapter, a reactant is any fuel or oxidizer supplied to the fuel 
cell system for the purposes of producing electrical energy. 

b)  The design and installation of a fuel cell system must prevent catastrophic or 

hazardous explosion due to ignition of fuel or vapors. 

c)  To comply with paragraph (b), catastrophic explosion due to ignition of fuel or vapors 
must be extremely improbable and not result from a single failure, a hazardous 
explosion due to ignition of fuel or vapors extremely remote, taking into account all 
factors, including; 

1)  Emission of explosive or toxic gases 

2)  Minimum ignition energy 

3)  Static electricity 

4)  Electrical faults 

5)  Over pressurization of hydrogen fuel storage vessels 

6)  Mechanical ignition sources 

7)  Electromagnetic waves 

8)  Lightning strikes 

9)  Fire 

10)  Heat emission 

d)  To comply with paragraph (c)(8) the following must be taken into account 

1)  Direct lightning strikes to areas having a high probability of stroke attachment; 
2)  Swept lightning strokes to areas where swept strokes are highly probable; and 

29 

3)  Lightning-induced or conducted electrical transients 

e)  Hydrogen leakage detection must be installed in any area of the airplane where 

hydrogen may accumulate and create a hazardous condition. 

f)  Fuel cell system installation must not damage surrounding structure of adjacent 
systems, equipment, or electrical wiring from corrosive fluids or gases that may 
escape in such a way as to cause a hazardous condition 

g)  The fuel cell system must have a failure sensing and warning system to alert the 

flightcrew if its failure affects safe operation of the airplane 

h)  The design and installation of the reactant supply must prevent hazardous conditions 
due to improper handling by crewmembers, passengers, and maintenance and 
servicing personnel. 

i) 

The fuel cell system must be designed to prevent hazardous hydrogen permeation 
and embrittlement of aircraft materials and structure, or otherwise to not have an 
adverse effect on the strength of materials or the flammability properties of 
materials. 

j)  Means must be available for controlling or extinguishing a fire, such as stopping flow 
of fluids, gasses, or vapors, shutting down equipment, fire containment, or use of 
extinguishing agents. 

k)  To protect fuel cell system design features that prevent catastrophic failures caused 
by all probable causes, the type design must include critical design configuration 
control limitations (CDCCLs) identifying those features and providing information to 
protect them. To ensure the continued effectiveness of those design features, the 
type design must also include inspection and test procedures, intervals between 
repetitive inspections and tests, and mandatory replacement times for those design 
features used in demonstrating compliance to paragraph (b) of this section. The 
applicant must include the information required by this paragraph in the 
Airworthiness Limitations section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness 
required by § 25.1529. 

l) 

The effect of fuel cell system operation on the cabin air must be assessed in normal 
operation and failure cases in order to show compliance to CS/CFR § 25.831 (a)(b)(c). 

m)  Storage or disposal of by-products, such as water and oxygen depleted air, must not 

introduce hazardous conditions. 

n)  Hydrogen pressure tanks, and lines between tanks and the shutoff means must be: 

1)  Protected from unsafe temperatures; and 

2)  Located where the probability and hazards of rupture in a crash landing are 

minimized  

30 

o)  Each fuel cell system fuel line within the fuselage must be designed and installed to 
allow a reasonable degree of deformation and stretching without leakage where its 
leakage could introduce a hazard. 

5.2  EXISTING REGULATIONS REQUIRING REVISION, CFR/CS PART 25 

The Committee also identified current CFR/CS 25 regulations that should be revised in order to 
support the certification of FCSs.  They are located here in Appendix G. 

Many of the regulations that the committee recommends be revised are located in CFR / CS 
part 25, subpart F, Powerplant.  Adoption of these recommendations will require a paradigm 
shift in how the airworthiness authorities and industry approach these regulations.  This is 
because these existing regulations are based on traditional combustion engines and APUs, and 
the use and storage of jet fuel.  While no changes are proposed that would alter the 
applicability of these regulations as they are applied today to existing powerplants and fuel 
systems, they would expand their applicability to include reactants used by a fuel cell system.  
As an example, in Table 19 of Appendix G it is recommended that § 25.957, Fuel flow between 
interconnected tanks, be modified by replacing the word fuel with the words fuel/reactant.  As 
revised, it would read as follows: 

If fuel or reactants can be pumped from one tank to another in flight, 
the fuel or reactant tank vents and the fuel or reactant transfer system 
must be designed so that no structural damage to the tanks can occur 
because of overfilling. 

Another example if § 25.967(a), Fuel tank installations.  The committee recommends that the 
word “fuel” be replaced by the words “fuel / reactant.” As revised it would read 

“(a) Each fuel or reactant tank must be supported so that tank loads 
(resulting from the weight of the fuel in the tanks) are not concentrated 
on unsupported tank surfaces.  In addition—…” 

The committee also recommends revisions to current regulations located in CFR / CS part 25, 
subpart D, Design and Construction; subpart F, Equipment; subpart G, Operating Limitations 
and Information, and subpart H, Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS). 

In all, 26 existing regulations are identified as needing revision to accommodate the installation 
of fuel cell systems in transport category airplanes. 

5.3  EXISTING REGULATIONS NOT REQUIRING REVISION, CFR/CS PART 25 

Furthermore, the Committee also collected those regulations currently in CFR / CS 25 that are 
seen as applicable, but do not require revision. These are included in this report because they 
are applicable to addressing some FCS hazards. A total of 69 current regulations have been 
identified as applicable to fuel cell systems.  They are located here in Appendix G.

5.4  PERFORMANCE BASED REGULATION 

Electrical energy supply devices are continually changing to meet the needs of the More Electric 
Aircraft.  Aircraft have used Lead Acid and Ni Cd batteries for years. These battery chemistries 
have been very reliable with known safety issues and mitigation techniques.  Currently, the 
regulatory requirements for batteries are covered under 14 CFR § 25.1353(b)/ EASA CS 
25.1353(c).  While the aerospace industry has a long history of using both primary and 
secondary batteries, it, like many industries, is moving to batteries with more energy dense 
electrolytes to reduce the size and weight of the battery system. There has been a great deal of 
work in standard organizations (e.g., RTCA, SAE, IEEE) to provide guidelines for the safe design, 
installation and operation of Lithium batteries.  However, the current regulatory requirements 
contained in CFR § 25.1353(b)/CS 25.1353(c) do not adequately address the unique safety 
issues associated with lithium based batteries.  Therefore, the FAA and other aviation 
airworthiness authorities have issued Special Conditions to address the unique hazards of these 
batteries.  The special conditions have been issued for both secondary or primary batteries; 
rechargeable and non-rechargeable. 

Batteries and capacitors provide short term power storage on the aircraft and it is well 
understood on how to integrate them into a transport aircraft. There are many well established 
aerospace committees working to further refine the technical requirements for batteries and 
capacitors.  The Committee felt hydrogen fuel cells would present the biggest challenge for 
integration and certification in an aircraft.  Therefore, the Committee did not investigate these 
types of energy storage devices and instead concentrated on the design, installation, operation 
and safety issues associated with hydrogen fuel cells. 

However, the Committee did develop a performance based requirement that is applicable to 
energy storage devices in general.  If adopted, it could be applied to fuels cells, super 
capacitors, storage batteries of differing chemistries including those that are lithium based, and 
other types of energy supply devices.  Adopting this recommendation would negate the need to 
continually develop and issue special conditions and also the need to revise it every time new 
ESD technologies are introduced in the aircraft.  The performance based regulation follows and 
is located here in Appendix G. 

14 CFR § 25.1353(b) / EASA CS 25.1353(c) (in lieu of the existing standard) 

a)  An energy supply/storage device, ESD, means any system installed on the airplane for 
the purposes of energy supply as required by systems or functions on the aircraft. 
The ESD includes functions of energy storage, energy generation or discharging 
energy, refilling or recharging, and or jettisoning. 

b)  For the purposes of this rule, ‘energy’ means any type of energy for the functioning 
of, or coming from the ESD, including, for example, fuels of any kind or electric 
current. 

c)  The characteristics of the ESD, including failure modes, must be identified. 

32 

d)  Failure of the ESD must not contribute to, or cause, a catastrophic effect on the 

airplane unless shown extremely improbably, or a hazardous effect on the airplane 
unless shown extremely remote. 

e) 

In normal operation or foreseeable malfunction of the ESD, no explosive, toxic, or 
corrosive gases or fluids: 

1)  May accumulate in hazardous quantities 

2)  May damage structures or adjacent essential equipment or systems 

3)  May endanger passengers or crew 

f)  Hazardous effects on structures or essential equipment or systems caused by the 
maximum amount of heat that can be generated during normal operation or 
probable malfunctions must be prevented. 

g)  The ESD as described in a), b) and c) must: 

1)  Maintain safe operating temperatures, pressures, or any other identified 

parameter, during normal operation (including storage, generation/discharging, 
refilling/recharging and / or jettisoning) 

2)  Provide, as necessary, means of protection, or controlling the ESD to prevent 
hazardous conditions during normal operation or probable malfunction. The 
flightcrew should be able to monitor, receive warnings, and control as 
appropriate. 

h) 

 Each energy-storage-refilling or -recharging system must be designed to: 

1)  prevent improper refilling or recharging 

2)  prevent contamination of the stored energy during likely operating conditions; 

and 

i) 

j) 

k) 

3)  prevent the occurrence of any hazard to the airplane or to persons during 

refilling or recharging 

Likely errors during ground handling of the airplane, the ESD, or its components, 
must not lead to a hazardous event, like hazardous loss of energy or misfit of ESD 
components. 

Suitability and reliability of ESDs must be proved based on experience, test, or 
analyses and be acceptable to the FAA. 

Instructions for continued airworthiness as required by §§ 25.1529 and 25.1729, 
must contain proper procedures including safe storage and exchange procedures of 
the ESD or its components if such a function / possibility is provided. 

5.5  OTHER CFR PARTS 

Although the Committee did not thoroughly go through the CFR / CS parts 23, 27, and 29 
airworthiness standards, the same concerns would apply with the typical differences between 

33 

the different product types.  The Committee therefore recommends when a rulemaking 
committee is created, this group amend the different airworthiness standards based on the 
conclusions presented in this report. 

5.6  OPERATIONAL REGULATIONS 

Operational requirements that are applicable to FCs contained in CFR parts 43, 91, 121, 125, 
and 129 are also identified in Appendix G, Table 21.  The Committee did not identify any 
revisions to these operational requirements that are necessary to accommodate the operation 
of a FCS, because they are of general applicability and apply to many different airplane systems 
and their maintenance. 

5.7  ADVISORY MATERIAL 

Because the Committee did not develop and recommend actual regulatory language (with a 
few exceptions), specific advisory material was not developed.  However, any advisory material 
later developed should be based on the data contained in Appendices A through H. Further 
explanation is contained in the following paragraphs and in Appendix G, SectionG.7. 

For example, section F.7 in Appendix F, discusses hydrogen fire extinguishing.  It states that a 
hydrogen fire should not be extinguished with water or chemicals. Static electricity generated 
across the leak orifice, or an adjacent hot surface, could explosively reignite the leaking 
hydrogen. The best way to deal with a hydrogen fire is to shut off the flow of hydrogen gas by 
closing supply valves, which will extinguish the flame. Essentially the shut-off of hydrogen is the 
only meaningful way to stop a hydrogen fire in flight because if the supply of hydrogen cannot 
be stopped the fire will always reignite on hot surfaces. 

Another section in Appendix F, section F.3.3 discusses the failure of pressure relief devices 
(PRDs).  It states, in part, that PRDs play a critical role in the implementation of most high-
pressure gas storage systems. In the event of an over-pressure situation induced by, for 
example, overfilling, exposure to excessive heat, or a liquid to gas phase change, the PRD will 
activate and allow the gas to escape to a safe location. The PRD should be set such that that it 
prevents catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel, irreversible damage, or degradation of the 
pressure vessel life cycle. 

A third example is the discussion of safety as it relates to a self-contained fuel cell powered 
Medevac unit.  Section E.4.2.2 of Appendix E, discusses some important safety considerations 
of the unit.  In part, it states that he FCS must be monitored and controlled real-time with a 
dedicated set of sensors, monitoring and control units. These controllers should be designed to 
render this system independent from any operator’s intervention. The FCS will then be able to 
control itself autonomously and shut itself off in any abnormal conditions encountered. 
However, the flight crew must have access to key data regarding the FCS state of health during 
operation (e.g., battery status, hydrogen content, temperature) and be in a position to shut it 
off if deemed necessary, via a dedicated interface (emergency button). 

34 

The preceding examples illustrate the type of information that is available in the appendices 
and the type of information that should be included in an advisory circular. 

  CONCLUSION 

The fuel cell technologies discussed in this report are at various levels of maturity.  For example, 
PEMFCs are in use today to power passenger cars, city busses, and warehouse forklifts.  Solid 
Oxide Fuel Cells are used in stationary applications to provide power for buildings.  The National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has used PEM fuel cells on the Gemini program 
and alkaline fuel cells on the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. Although fuel cells have been 
demonstrated and are being developed for use in unmanned aircraft applications, fuel cells are 
currently not widely used in manned aircraft applications.  Only recently have applications been 
made to certify fuel cells in commercial aviation.  As certain technological, logistical, and 
regulatory hurdles are overcome, the use of fuel cells in both manned and unmanned aviation 
will become more prevalent. 

The following paragraphs list, in bullet form, some salient points regarding the readiness of fuel 
cell systems to be deployed in an airborne environment for several applications (discussed in 
Appendix E) and what the FAA and other authorities can do to facilitate the certification of fuel 
cell systems. 

6.1  WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY ROADBLOCKS TO DESIGNING AND INSTALLING A FUEL CELL 
SYSTEM IN AN AIRPLANE TODAY? 

•  Weight/Volume 
•  Technology maturity 
•  Cost benefit 

o  Clean sheet design necessary for major FCS installation (e.g., APU) 

•  Lack of comprehensive airworthiness standards

replaceable/swappable H2 tanks 

Auxiliary Power 

•  Fuel cells cannot compete with gas turbine APU in foreseeable future as a form fit function 

replacement 

•  Automotive PEM FCPS technology is mature for airplane, PROVIDED: 

o  Hydrogen refilling infrastructure is available at airports,   
o  Airplane modification to improve efficiency from pneumatic systems such as 
environmental control systems and main engine start (~2030) is necessary,

certification. 

•  The packaging of this system requires a relatively small amount of fuel for infrequent 

operation of low power for short duration.   

o  No refueling, other than a possible service cart to top-off the system due to small

•  Fuel cell technology is capable of supporting a wide range of UAS applications within the 

next few years.  

o  Some early products currently available at power levels under 1kWfuel cell 

technology is being actively developed and utilized in UAS because of current 
market demand for the endurance and operational benefits they provide 
compared to batteries and combustion engines.

 COMPARISON OF FUEL CELLS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES 

  FUEL CELL BENEFITS 

Fuel cells are under consideration for use on aircraft because of their unique properties that 
may provide substantial benefits as compared to batteries and combustion engines currently in 
use today. 

Each fuel cell and the system embodiment for each application can have differences as varied 
as heat engines. One could say aircraft propulsion is provided by the combustion of fuel and 
oxidizer to provide forward thrust. This can range from a piston engine propelling a general 
aviation type aircraft, a turboprop on a military transport airplane, a geared turbofan on a 
commercial airplane, a scramjet on a hypersonic aircraft, and H2-O2 main engines. Similarly, 
fuel cells range widely in characteristics. Weight, life, safety, maintenance, cost, reliability, 
volume, noise signature, thermal signature, type of oxidant, type of primary fuel, power profile, 
efficiency, CO2 reduction, air pollution, and more are all typical factors. Optimization of any one 
or combination of these can dramatically alter the fuel cell and fuel storage design and 
determine if benefits are sufficient to merit inclusion on an aircraft type. 

With that in mind, there are broad fundamental differences between fuel cells and batteries 
and heat engines. The following provides a brief overview of these factors. 

  TECHNOLOGY COMPARISONS 

This section discusses the comparisons of fuel cells to batteries and fuel cells to combustion 
systems by comparing factors such as size, cost, and energy density.  It also compares specific 
power versus power density for various energy conversion methods as shown in Figure 9. 

A.2.1  Fuel Cells Compared to Batteries 

A fuel cell is similar to conventional combustion based power generation; it converts separately 
stored chemical energy into electrical power.  This is also shown in Figure 9. The fuel in a fuel 
cell is converted electrochemically instead of by burning the fuel and converting the generated 
heat to mechanical energy as is done in an airplane engine or auxiliary power unit. By 
comparison, a battery combines both the storage function and the power conversion function.  
The chemical energy of the reactants inside the battery is converted electrochemically to 
electrical power.  By separating the fuel (chemical reactants) and the electrochemical 
conversion cells, a fuel cell system can optimize both fuel storage and power generation. 

39 

Figure 9. Fuel Cells Convert Stored Fuel into Electrical Power Similar to Conventional 
Combustion Based Systems 

An illustration comparing size and cost of fuel cells to batteries is shown in Figure 10. As shown, 
both batteries and fuel cells increase in cost and weight as the amount of energy stored 
increases. An advantage for batteries is that when small amounts of energy storage are 
required, only a small number of batteries are required. However, to increase storage, more 
batteries must be added. For example, if twice the amount of storage is needed for the battery, 
twice as many complete batteries are added.

The crossover point where fuel 
cells provide advantage can vary

kWh Energy Stored  

For fuel cells, the scenario is different. Just like in an automobile, the fuel cell separates power 
production (equivalent to an automobile engine) from energy storage (equivalent to a gasoline 
tank). If little or no energy needs to be stored the cost and weight of the fuel cell and near 
empty tank must be accounted for. In these cases, the battery has an advantage. However, if 
more storage is needed, the tank only needs to be filled and if even more storage is needed a 
larger tank can be provided. Typically, with current technology, the cost/weight of simply 
expanding the fuel tank and adding fuel is far less than adding the same amount of energy 
stored in batteries. As a packaged storage device, the United States Department of Energy (U.S. 
DOE) has a target of a value for net kWh/kg of a hydrogen storage system of 2500 Wh/kg. The 
overall energy density of a complete fuel cell system will be lower than this value since it 
includes the fuel cell stack itself and the tank end caps, fittings and related packaging but the 
marginal value is very high. This means if the fuel cell has been justified for a given application 
and the fuel cell system weight is already budgeted, the marginal energy density of 2500Wh/kg 
exceeds almost all known batteries. That is why, in Figure 10, the slope of the batteries is far 
steeper than the slope of the added fuel. The fuel cell system weight will, of course, depend on 
the fuel cell type and other system requirements (power level, fuel type, etc.). 

A representation of this is shown in Figure 11 that maps fuel cells and batteries in regard to 
specific energy or energy density, kWh/kg vs. specific power or power density, kW/kg. This 
chart from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, known as a Ragone chart, illustrates the very high 
energy density able to be achieved via fuel cells. This energy density makes the choice of a fuel 
cell very attractive.  However, the applications where a fuel cell makes sense, will depend on 

41 

 
the level of energy required and the chosen type of fuel cell system technology. Appendix E 
covers applications and how fuel cells can work in these applications. 

Figure 11. Ragone Chart Comparing Batteries and Fuel Cells 

A.2.2  Fuel Cells Compared to Combustion Systems 

While a fuel cell shares the heat engine characteristic of separating power production and 
energy storage as shown in Figure 11, a fuel cell can typically achieve higher operating 
efficiencies than combustion processes. The potential savings, from a U.S. Department of 
Energy study3, are illustrated in Figure 12 and Figure 13 where the efficiency for the 
conventional main engine generators feeding the 230 VAC buss of a modern commercial 
aircraft is shown at 53% (Figure 12) while the projected solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is shown at 
65% (Figure 13), if the DOE programs hit their development targets.  It should be recognized 
that there is still a substantial challenge reaching those targets.

A simplified representation is shown in Figure 14 illustrating how higher efficiency achievable 
by a fuel cell may lead to overall savings. In this figure, the higher efficiency of the fuel cell as 
compared to the combustion process can lead to overall savings even for higher initial weights. 
However, as also noted in the DOE study the projected weight of current SOFC technology 
makes practical application, at this time, challenging on a weight basis alone.

Weight Saving as Compared to Combustion Processes 

Figure 15 compares the specific power and power density of fuel cells and combustion engines. 
The figure shows that a SOFC could potentially be lighter than a combustion system, however, 
these power densities have not yet been demonstrated in working commercial prototypes. 
There is still development that will be needed and perhaps a change in power system usage 
model on the aircraft to make a fuel cell attractive in some of the potential aircraft applications.

 FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES 

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the energy of the chemical reaction 
between a fuel, such as hydrogen or hydrogen rich gases, alcohols, or hydrocarbons, and an 
oxidant, such as air or oxygen (O2), to direct current (DC) power, heat, and other reaction 
products. 

This appendix provides a basic technical background on multiple fuel cell options and their 
fundamental characteristics.  Two technologies; proton exchange membrane (PEM) in both low 
and high temperature versions and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) will be explored further in 
Appendix C to understand how they work, how they might be used for aircraft applications, and 
where the issues might be that will need to be addressed. Background on hazards posed by 
these technologies is also provided. 

Section B.1 looks at the fuel cell technology options and their basic capability. In section B.2, 
two technologies, proton exchange membrane and solid oxide fuel cells are examined in detail. 
The details of these systems are provided; key integration issues and failure modes are 
identified. The types of fuel are also described as well as their characteristics and integration 
issues. 

Appendix D looks at the applications and how the fuel cell could be used and integrated into 
the aircraft. Additional discussions of key issues associated with the fuel cells in those 
applications are also identified. 

  FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS 

B.1.1  Overview 

There is a range of fuel cell technologies now used in various applications.  These use a variety 
of membrane and fuel types, and produce various byproducts as shown in Figure 16. Fuel Cell 
Chemistry of Various Fuel Cell Types.  Fuel Cells are electrochemical devices that convert 
chemical energy of a fuel and oxidant directly into electrical energy.  Fuel cells produce 
electricity through an electrochemical reaction and not through a combustion process; they are 
much more efficient and environmentally benign than conventional electric power generation 
processes. Their inherent characteristics make them uniquely suitable to address the 
environmental, climate change, and water concerns associated with fossil fuel based electric 
power generation. 

Fuel sources for the fuel cell are to a large extent application dependent and can include liquid 
hydrogen, gaseous hydrogen, light hydrocarbons (when used with an SOFC), solid fuels 
(hydrides etc. where the hydrogen is either product of a reaction or decomposition), fuel 
reforming, or electrolysis.

B.1.2  Direct-Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) 

This is a subcategory of proton-exchange fuel cells (discussed in section B.1.3) in which 
methanol is used as the fuel. Their main advantage is the ease of transport of methanol, an 
energy-dense yet reasonably stable liquid at all environmental conditions.  The general cell 
concept is shown in Figure 17. 

Figure 17. Direct-Methanol Fuel Cell 

Efficiency is quite low for these cells, so they are targeted especially to portable applications, 
where energy and power density are more important than efficiency. 

DMFCs use a methanol solution (usually around 1M, i.e. about 3% in mass) to carry the reactant 
into the cell; common operating temperatures are in the range 20°C to 150°C, where high 
temperatures are usually pressurized. DMFCs themselves are more efficient at high 
temperatures and pressures, but these conditions end up causing so many losses in the 
complete system that the advantage is lost; therefore, atmospheric-pressure configurations are 
currently preferred. 

Because of the methanol cross-over, a phenomenon by which methanol diffuses through the 
membrane without reacting, methanol is fed as a weak solution: this decreases efficiency 
significantly, since crossed-over methanol, after reaching the air side (the cathode), 
immediately reacts with air; though the exact kinetics are debated, the end result is a reduction 
of the cell voltage and efficiencies. 

52 

 
 
B.1.3  Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) 

The proton exchange membrane, also known as PEM, uses a polymer electrolyte.  PEM is one of 
the furthest developed (along with alkaline fuel cells) and most commonly used fuel cell 
systems. It was original developed and used by NASA in-Gemini missions in early 1960’s.  PEM 
FCs currently: 

•  Power automobiles, city busses, and forklifts, 

•  Serve as portable power sources, and 

•  Provide backup power in lieu of stationary batteries in offices. 

The PEM system allows compact design and achieves a high energy-to-weight ratio. Another 
advantage is a relatively quick start-up when applying hydrogen. The low temperature version 
of the technology runs at a moderate temperature of below 80°C, with a maximum operating 
temperature of 80°C to 100°C and is 50 percent efficient. (The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) 
is 25–30 percent efficient.)  The high temperature versions run between 100°C to 200°C and is 
approximately 30% efficient. 

The PEM fuel cell concept, shown in Figure 18, generally requires a platinum catalyst on the 
membrane and needs to manage the water at the membrane. The stack requires pure 
hydrogen; lower fuel grades can degrade the catalyst performance. 

53 

 
Figure 18. Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell 

B.1.4  Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC) 

The alkaline fuel cell concept is shown in Figure 19.  Also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its 
British inventor, Francis Thomas Bacon, it is one of the most developed fuel cell technologies. 
NASA has used alkaline fuel cells since the mid-1960s.  They were used in Apollo-series missions 
and on the Space Shuttle. Alkaline fuel cells consume hydrogen and pure oxygen producing 
potable water, heat, and electricity. They are among the most efficient fuel cells, having the 
potential to reach 70%.  They operate at temperatures less than 100°C. 

There are two main variants of AFCs that exist: static electrolyte and flowing electrolyte. Static, 
or immobilized, electrolyte cells of the type used in the Apollo space craft and the Space Shuttle 
typically use an asbestos separator saturated in potassium hydroxide. Water production is 
managed by evaporation out the anode, as shown in Figure 19, which produces pure water that 
may be reclaimed for other uses. These fuel cells typically use platinum catalysts to achieve 
maximum volumetric and specific efficiencies.  Flowing electrolyte designs, tend to use a more 
open matrix, which allows the electrolyte to flow either between the electrodes (parallel to the 
electrodes) or through the electrodes in a transverse direction (the ASK-type or EloFlux fuel 
cell). 

54 

 
 
Figure 19. Alkaline Fuel Cell 

B.1.5  Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PCFC) 

The PCFC concept is shown in Figure 20.  Phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive 
electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode. These cells 
commonly work in temperatures of 150°C to 200°C. This high temperature will cause heat and 
energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly. This heat can be used to produce 
steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system. Using this 
heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40–50% to 
about 80%. Phosphoric acid, the electrolyte used in PAFCs, is a non-conductive liquid acid which 
forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit. Since the 
hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small, platinum is used as catalyst to increase this 
ionization rate. A key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte. This 
increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid. 

55 

 
 
Figure 20. Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell 

B.1.6  Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFCs) 

The MCFC concept is shown in Figure 21.  Require a high operating temperature of 600°C to 
700°C, similar to SOFCs (refer to section B.1.7). MCFCs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as 
an electrolyte, and this salt liquefies at high temperatures, allowing for the movement of 
charge within the cell – in this case, negative carbonate ions. 

56 

 
 
Figure 21. Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell 

Like SOFCs, MCFCs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode, 
eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally. The reforming process creates CO2 
emissions. MCFC-compatible fuels include natural gas, biogas, and gas produced from coal. The 
hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water, carbon 
dioxide, electrons, and small amounts of other chemicals. The electrons travel through an 
external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode. There, oxygen from the air and 
carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that 
replenish the electrolyte, completing the circuit. 

As with SOFCs, MCFC disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating 
temperature. This makes MCFC systems less suitable for mobile applications, and this 
technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of 
MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte 
lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC 
components, decreasing the durability and cell life. 

Molten carbonate fuel cells hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies, including 
their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to "carbon coking", which refers to carbon 
build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel 

57 

 
 
reforming process. Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with 
the system. 

B.1.7  Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) 

Solid oxide fuel cells, shown in Figure 22, use a solid material, most commonly a ceramic 
material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made 
entirely of solid materials, they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of 
fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high operating temperatures 
(500°C to 1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas. 

Figure 22 Solid Oxide Fuel Cell 

SOFCs are unique since in those, negatively charged oxygen ions travel from the cathode 
(positive side of the fuel cell) to the anode (negative side of the fuel cell) instead of positively 
charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode, as is the case in all other types 
of fuel cells. Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen 
ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the 
anode. The reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products. Carbon dioxide 

58 

 
 
may also be a by-product depending on the fuel, but the carbon emissions from an SOFC 
system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant. 

SOFC systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas. However, since hydrogen is 
necessary for the reactions listed above, the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms. For 
the fuel cell to operate, the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas. SOFCs are capable 
of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane (natural gas), propane and butane.

 FUEL CELL SELECTION FOR USE IN AN AVIATION ENVIRONMENT 

  INTRODUCTION 

This appendix discusses two types of fuel cells; PEM and SOFC.  These two technologies are the 
most feasible types for installation on board an aircraft. While a DMFC might also be selected 
for low power applications, it is not covered in this section. Some applications where a DMFC 
could be used would be for self-contained portable low power systems (i.e. laptop computer 
power modules) and smaller unmanned aerial vehicles. The following sections will describe the 
PEM and SOFC technology in more depth than the overview provided in Appendix B. The 
information on how the technology is configured into a system with all the components and 
subsystems is also discussed.  Important features that might have an impact on the aircraft 
safety are discussed.  System failure modes will also be identified for consideration in Sections 
C.4, C.5 and C.7. 

Two variations of the PEM technology are discussed; low and high temperature.  PEM fuel cells 
are generally more mature than SOFC for transportation applications.  PEM fuel cells, for 
example, are being used in commercial automotive application, while SOFCs are used 
commercially primarily in the stationary power market, with other SOFC mobile applications 
still in development stages. This will tend to favor PEM FCS for early introduction into the 
aircraft.  However, the projected SOFC capability and technology maturation over the next few 
years may allow for greater opportunity for SOFC’s in aircraft applications. 

Proton exchange membrane and SOFC technology could also be used for regenerative systems 
described in Appendix D, section D.10, Regenerative FC Energy Storage.  This technology could 
be used to generate fuel on the aircraft for fuel cell operation as needed by the fuel cell.  This 
has the potential to store more energy than a battery of the same weight (if the energy storage 
is above 10 kWh) or store energy that might otherwise be wasted as heat. 

  THE FUEL CELL SYSTEM 

The fuel cell system, shown in conceptual blocks in the Figure 23, is made up of the fuel cell 
stack and subsystems.  The fuel cell stack is that portion of the fuel cell system that performs 
the electrochemical conversion of fuel and oxidant into electric energy, thermal energy, and 
exhaust products. The systems also includes an enclosure, fitting, wiring, and all devices 
allowing the connection to other fuel cell subsystems. 

61 

 
Figure 23. Fuel Cell System Block Diagram 

The following descriptions provide a general overview of each of the subsystems shown in 
Figure 23.  These sytems, and some that are specific to either PEMFC and SOFC system designs 
are discussed in greater detail in the following sections of this appendix. The applications 
sections also provides detail for the specific concepts offered  as examples of a system for the 
specific application. 

C.2.1  Oxidant Supply 

The oxidant supply subsystem is generally composed of the oxygen or air needed for the fuel 
cell stack and the equipment needed to deliver it to the stack.  It may include the tank to 
contain the oxidant and the valves, regulators, and piping to prepare oxidant for the fuel cell 
stack.  Additional detail on the oxidant supply design options and consideration is provided in 
Appendix D, section D.9, Oxygen Sources and Environmental Control Impacts. 

C.2.2  Fuel Supply 

This subsystem is generally composed of the fuel needed for the fuel cell stack, the tank to 
contain it and the valves, regulators and piping to prepare the fuel for the fuel cell stack.  This 
can include any special fuel (H2, reformate, enriched H2, or other not common to aircraft) and 
tank (not from kerosene tank), even if separately located, is part of FCS.  It also includes a 
reformer to process, for example, fuel from the aircraft tank to make it suitable for the fuel cell 
stack.  Additional detail on the fuel supply design options and consideration is provided in 
oxygen sources Appendix D, section D.9, Oxygen Sources and Environmental Control Impacts..  
Discussion of the reformer options is provided in section D.8 of Appendix D, Reformer. 

62 

 
 
C.2.3  Fuel Cell Stack 

This subsystem is composed of the cells that combine the reactants electrochemically and 
produce power.  The stack also produces water, waste heat, and in the case of an SOFC, CO2.  
PEM stacks generally include water cooling to the cells to remove heat to the cooling heating 
system.  In cases where humidification of the reactants is required and water must be removed, 
like the PEMFC stack, the fuel cell stack subsystem also includes components needed for water 
removal. 

C.2.4  Exhaust Conditioning 

This subsystem includes any components needed to transport or manage the water or CO2 
products.  Exhaust lines are considered part of FC system if they are connected to the exhaust 
conditioning components of the FC.  It does not include any exhaust lines that would be 
included in the basic aircraft type design (i.e., those not installed specifically to accommodate 
the fuel cell system. It can also include inert gases that are a part of the fuel and oxidant supply.  
It may also include oxygen depleted air. 

C.2.5  Cooling/Heating 

This subsystem includes the means to remove heat from the stack and other components in the 
FC system.  It may include the component to regulate the temperatures within the system.  This 
also includes, and is not limited to, fans, blowers, vents, liquid loops and heat exchangers 
controlled by the FC system.  The function can be shared by FC system and aircraft.  The FC 
supplier must provide heat load and rejection information to aircraft manufacturer. 

C.2.6  Electric Power Output 

This system conditions the power from the FC stack and matches it to the aircraft’s electrical 
bus requirements.  A battery may be included in this section if needed for peak power or start 
up if the bus cannot provide the power for starting.  Wiring and other electrical wiring 
interconnection system (EWIS) components necessary for the installation and proper 
functioning of the FC are part of the FC system.  EWIS components basic to the aircraft’s type 
design are not part of the FC system. 

C.2.7  FC Monitoring and Control 

This subsystem controls all the FC functions and provide communication and command data 
lines  to the aircraft.  A battery may be included in this section if needed for controls backup 
power or startup power.  Wiring installed with the FC and connectors are part of the FC system.  
Wiring that is part of the aircraft is not part of the FC system.  The flight deck indicators and 
controls for the FC are not part of the FC system 

63 

 
C.2.8  Enclosure 

This subsystem may be an open or sealed structure around part or all the FC system.  This 
structure may be required for the proper operation, safety, or mechanical attachment of the 
fuel cell system and is part of the FC installation.  Mounting features that provide mechanical 
attachment of the enclosure or system components to the aircraft are part of the FC system. 

  PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE (PEM) FUEL CELL: LOW & HIGH TEMPERATURE 

The core of the PEM fuel cell consists of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is 
placed between two flow-field plates. The MEA consists of two electrodes, the anode and the 
cathode, which are each coated on one side with a thin catalyst layer (usually platinum) and 
separated by a solid membrane electrolyte. The flow-field plates direct hydrogen to the anode 
and oxygen (from the air) to the cathode. Refer to Figure 24. 

Figure 24. Example of a Single Cell PEM Fuel Cell 

64 

 
 
On the anode, hydrogen flows through channels in flow field plates and reaches the anode 
catalyst layer. The platinum catalyst promotes the separation of hydrogen into protons 
(hydrogen ions) and electrons. The free electrons, produced at the anode, are conducted in the 
form of a usable electric current through the external circuit. Hydrogen can be supplied to a 
fuel cell directly or may be reformed from natural gas, methanol, or petroleum using a fuel 
processor, which converts the hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon dioxide through a 
catalytic chemical reaction. This is known as fuel reforming. 

On the cathode, oxygen from the air flows through the channels in flow field plates. The 
hydrogen protons that migrate through the proton exchange membrane combine with oxygen 
in air and electrons returning from the external circuit to form pure water and heat. The air 
stream also removes the water created as a by-product of the electrochemical process. 

The reactions occurring in the fuel cell is as follows: 

Anode reaction: H2  2H  2e 

Cathode Reaction: ½ O2 + 2e + 2H  H2O 

Overall reaction: H2 + ½O2 → H2O + Electricity + Heat 

As heat is also produced in the overall reaction, it must be removed to maintain the target 
operating temperature.  Heat removal may be done directly through the air stream or via a 
cooling fluid flowing through coolant channels that are typically integrated in the flow field 
plates. 

A single cell consists of the membrane electrode assembly and two flow-field plates. To obtain 
the desired power output, cells may be repeated in series to form a fuel cell stack.  Increasing 
the number of cells in a fuel cell stack increases the output stack voltage, while increasing the 
surface area of the cells increases the output current. The fuel cell stack can have elastomeric 
seals between cells and cell components and/or encapsulated externally to prevent coolant or 
reactant leaks.  The stack also contains the manifolds that provide even distribution of 
reactants and coolant to each cell. 

There are two version of the PEM FCS; the low temperature (LT) and the high temperature (HT), 
based on different cell membrane technology.  There are detailed discussions on each 
technology in the following sections, but the primary trade-offs are: 

•  LT is more mature 
•  LT has higher efficiency 
•  HT is less sensitive to contaminant in the air that could cause performance degradation 
•  HT has a smaller heat rejection system 

65 

 
  LOW-TEMPERATURE PEM FUEL CELLS 

Low Temperature PEM (LT-PEM) Fuel Cells are typically limited to less than 120°C due to 
stability of the membrane and evaporation of water. More practically it is limited to 85°C to 
90°C in high or peak temperature application. Because of the thin membrane, and low 
resistance losses, LT-PEM fuel cells tend to deliver high power density and offer the advantages 
of low weight and volume, compared to other fuel cell types. The low temperature operation 
also allows them to start quickly (less warm-up time) and to start from freeze condition (0oC), 
which makes them particularly well suited for transportation applications such as automobiles 
and fleet vehicles. However, water must be managed to keep the membrane wet for ion 
conduction, but not flooded, and carbon monoxide (CO) easily contaminates catalysts at low 
temperature, complicating use of reformed fuels 

Figure 25 is a typical schematic of a LT-PEM Fuel Cell System. Within the boundary diagram, it 
can be generalized that the following subsystems (in addition to the PEM Fuel Cell Stack) are 
typical of a PEM Fuel Cell System: 

•  Air Subsystem; 
•  Fuel Delivery Subsystem; 
•  Coolant Subsystem; 
•  Power Management System. 

Figure 25. Typical Low-Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Operational Diagram 

66 

 
 
C.4.1  LT-PEM Oxidant Supply—Air Subsystem 

As O2 is required in the cathode reaction, every PEM system must have an air or O2 delivery 
subsystem.  The Air subsystem has two main roles: to deliver the air at the required flow, 
pressure, temperature, and humidity; and to exhaust the depleted air, anode purge gas and 
liquid water out of the fuel cell system.  A typical air subsystem consists of the following 
components to perform the following functions: 

•  Air compressor or blower—delivers the air to correct pressure and flow 
•  Heat exchanger—takes the incoming air supply, and heats it up with the coolant outlet 
stream, in preparation for air humidification. This heat exchanger is coupled with the 
coolant subsystem. 

•  Humidifier—takes the heated air, and humidifies it with the air exhaust, exiting the fuel cells 

stack. 

Some systems are designed to operate on pure O2. For these systems, an air compressor or 
blower is not required. Furthermore, because there is no nitrogen gas (N2), the O2exhaust 
exiting the fuel cell stack can be recirculated with the incoming O2 (like what is shown in 
Figure 25 for the H2 side) to provide the correct temperature and humidity, thus reducing or 
eliminating the need for the heat exchanger and humidifier. 

C.4.2  LT-PEM Fuel Supply—Fuel Delivery Subsystem 

As H2 is required in the Anode reaction, every PEM system must have a fuel delivery subsystem.  
The fuel delivery subsystem has three main roles: supply the fuel cell stack with the correct 
pressure, flow; recirculate the H2 exiting the fuel stack with the incoming H2; and separate 
liquid water from the H2 exhaust and direct it the oxidant exhaust stream.  A typical fuel 
delivery system has the following components: 

•  Pressure regulators—to regulate to the correct pressure and flow 
•  H2 recirculation system—to recirculate the anode exhaust with the incoming H2 
•  Water separator—to separate out liquid water 

C.4.3  LT-PEM Fuel Cell Stack 

The fuel cell stack is composed of a series of electrochemical cells.  As illustrated in Figure 24, 
these cells have a membrane and a means to conduct electrical current.  The stack contains 
flow passages and manifolds for the oxidant and fuel, as well as coolant that must be circulated 
to remove excess heat (to cooling system) and keep the stack at the target operating 
temperatures.  The stack can have elastomeric seals between cells and cell components and/or 
encapsulated externally to prevent coolant or reactant leaks. 

67 

 
C.4.4  LT-PEM Exhaust Conditioning 

Conditioning of the exhaust in a typical low temperature PEM system may include:  transfer of 
heat and humidity from the exhaust to the incoming oxidant supply; removal of liquid water; 
and extra dilution of H2.  Extra dilution of H2 in the exhaust is further discussed as follows. 

The exhaust from a typical low temperature PEM system design may combine both the anode 
and cathode exhaust refers to the may contain hydrogen gas combine the anode exhaust 
before venting to atmosphere.  Therefore, hydrogen gas may be present in the exhaust from 
the anode purging or from transfer leaks through the fuel cell membrane.  During normal 
operation, the hydrogen concentration in the exhaust will be well below flammable limits, but 
to minimize the risk of ignition event extra dilution of the exhaust such as dilution by cooling 
fan air flow should be considered. 

C.4.5  LT-PEM Cooling/Heating 

As heat will be generated by the PEM electrochemical reaction, every PEM system must have a 
coolant subsystem to extract the heat that is generated.  A secondary purpose is to provide 
heating to the incoming air supply. A typical coolant subsystem has the following main 
components: 

•  Coolant Pump and thermostatic valve system—to provide the correct flow, temperature 

and pressure within the coolant loop. 

•  Heat Exchanger and bypass valve system—the bypass valve system directs a portion of the 
coolant from the main coolant loop to the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger is coupled 
with the air delivery system, and provides heating to incoming air supply.  Since the 
operating temperature is generally around 80 °C, the heat exchangers are much larger than 
high temperature PEM and SOFC. 

C.4.6  LT-PEM Electrical Power Output: Power Management Subsystem 

The main purpose of the power management subsystem is to collect the current/voltage that 
the fuel cell stack outputs to: provide power main load and to power the balance of plant 
components within the fuel cell system. 

C.4.7  LT-PEM FC Monitoring and Control 

The fuel monitoring and control system should provide two main functions:  provide control 
interlocks to ensure safe operation and prevent damage to the system on shutdown; and 
provide operating state control to enable start-up and shut-down sequence and fault 
responses. 

68 

 
C.4.8  LT-PEM Enclosure 

The LT- PEM Fuel Cell stack and certain of the sub-systems may be packaged in an enclosure.  
The enclosure must provide:  maintenance access; ventilation inlet; ventilation outlet; and/or 
ingress protection against environmental elements such as dust, dirt or water.  Hydrogen gas 
leak detection is also needed and system and fuel supply shut-down should occur if a detection 
occurs. 

C.4.9  LT-PEM Startup and Shutdown 

The time for a LT-PEM Fuel Cell stack to produce power can be quick and the power can be 
generated as soon as reactants gases are supplied to stack.  If the PEM fuel cell stack is started 
below freezing conditions, there will be additional time that is required to warm up and 
prepare the stack to have access to the reactant gases. 

Exact details of start-up and shut-down sequence are considered proprietary. However, in 
general, start-up and shutdown strategies are designed to enable the safe start and shutdown 
of a fuel cell, and to mitigate against conditions that lead to failure modes within the PEM fuel 
cell stack.  Nitrogen gas may be needed to inert the fuel cell stack at shutdown.  Water must 
also be managed if the system will drop below freezing. 

C.4.10  LT-PEM Airframe Integration Considerations 

Low temperature PEM fuel cells have inherent operational characteristics that should be 
considered for airframe integration: 

•  LT-PEM Fuel Cells operate at temperatures of 60 °C to 80°C.  The heat discharge could be 

usable in the in other aircraft systems. 

•  LT-PEM Fuel Fell stacks generate water as a byproduct. The water could be used for other 
aircraft system needs in the pressurized volume and the passenger cabin.  Also, in an 
environment where temperatures get below freezing (while the fuel cell is not running) 
designs must clear the system of water or be water freeze tolerant to avoid events that lead 
to failure of the fuel cell stacks. 

•  Some LT-PEM Fuel Cell system designs need N2 to use during shutdown.  As such, the 
addition of N2 pressurized gas bottle would be needed for this type of system design. 

•  LT-PEM Fuel Cell system designs need to purge the anode exhaust. As such, a safe venting 

path for the exhaust is required. 

•  LT-PEM Fuel Cells need to reject about 1 kW of heat for every 1 kW in electrical power. 

Therefore, a low temperature (60-80°C) coolant subsystem and radiator to reject the heat is 
necessary. The installation needs to provide an adequate area for a radiator and in a 
suitable location that will allow heat to be rejected. 

69 

 
C.4.11  LT-PEM Fuel Cell Failure Modes 

Examples of common LT-PEM Fuel Cell failure modes include hazardous fluid leakage that may 
develop over time or in response to cell reversal. This includes fuel-to-coolant transfer, which 
may result in the presence of hydrogen within (and possibly emitted from) the cooling system, 
and fuel-to-air transfer, which may result in potentially flammable mixtures being emitted 
during operation. 

Cell reversal is typically caused by overheating or fuel starvation. Cell reversal failures are 
typically uncommon (and may be mitigated through cell voltage monitoring), but are most 
frequently caused by a lack of protons (i.e., fuel starvation) or failure to conduct protons (i.e., 
overheat or dehydration causing loss of membrane conductivity) in one or more cells, where 
the remaining cells then drive these starved cells into voltage reversal, causing an electrical 
shorting failure across the affected cell’s membrane. These membrane-shorting failures then 
permit fuel-to-air transfer and the possible formation of flammable emissions in the cathode 
exhaust, and/or if plates are cracked or damaged, can lead to ignited external fuel leaks, and/or 
fuel-to-coolant transfer leaks putting potentially flammable concentrations of hydrogen in the 
system exhaust or ventilation flows, or in the radiator or storage tank head-space within cooling 
systems. 

Risks that may lead to cell reversal result from non-intentional operational conditions include: 

•  Loss of, or inadequate, coolant flow 
•  Loss of, or inadequate, humidity 
•  Loss of, or inadequate, fuel supply 

Hazardous fluid leakage due to cell reversal damage may (or may not), depending on stack and 
system design and levels of oxidant O2-enrichment above atmospheric, lead to immediate or 
delayed ignition of flammable emissions or leakage; causing further potential hazards (e.g., 
toxic smoke and possible hydrogen fluoride emissions from the cells), with possible secondary 
involvement of stack or enclosure insulating materials, and the possibility for high pressures 
within the packaging or system cathode exhaust due to hydrogen combustion or detonation. 

Hazardous fluid leakage may also result if the fuel cell stack is operated above its maximum 
allowable working pressure and/or maximum allowable cross pressure, causing membrane 
failure and internal transfer and/or external leakage. 

  HIGH-TEMPERATURE PEM FUEL CELLS 

A high temperature PEM could be the same technology as a low temperature PEM operating at 
a higher pressure or a PEM with a different electrolyte, as in the case of a Phosphoric Acid Fuel 
cell.  High Temperature PEM (HT-PEM) Fuel Cells maybe based on a phosphoric acid doped 
Polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane. Phosphoric acid acts as the proton carrier through the 
membrane, instead of liquid water in the case of LT-PEM Fuel Cells. Therefore, no water 
management is needed, and removal of produced water vapor is considerably eased-up 

70 

 
compared to liquid water in the case of LT-PEM Fuel Cells. Also, membrane performance is not 
subjected to a hydration requirement for proton conduction, or to flooding conditions in case 
of inefficient water removal. 

High Temperature PEM Fuel Cells operate typically between 120°C and 180°C to ensure that 
water is produced as vapor and to ensure stability of the membrane. Operating HT-PEM below 
100°C is possible but may result in reduced performance and durability due to liquid water 
production washing the phosphoric acid. Operating HT-PEM Fuel Cells above 180 °C is possible, 
up to 200°C or even 220°C, but may result in accelerated aging and reduced lifetime. Due to 
thicker membrane and higher activation losses compared to LT-PEM Fuel Cells, HT-PEM Fuel 
Cells offer lower power and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of HT-PEM Fuel Cell has 
started more recently, hence yielding a less mature technology than the LT-PEM Fuel Cell. But it 
is expected that nominal performances will soon increase to viable levels as the technology 
matures.  The high temperature operation requires more warm-up time, but presents the 
advantage of enhanced heat exchange due to a higher temperature difference between the 
fuel cell and the cold source where the heat is dissipated. Consequently, the size of heat 
exchangers for fuel cell cooling, or for heat recovery, can be reduced in size. The high 
temperature functioning allows a higher tolerance to pollutants (such as CO, CO2, NOx), notably 
in fuel, offering more opportunities to operate with a fuel processor (e.g., reformers). 

Figure 26 is a typical schematic of a HT-PEM Fuel Cell System.  It is comprised of an air 
subsystem, fuel delivery subsystem, thermal management subsystem, and power management 
subsystem.  These subsystems are described in the following paragraphs. 

Figure 26. Simplified Example Schematic of High Temperature PEM FC System 

71 

 
 
C.5.1  HT-PEM Air Subsystem 

The air subsystem of a HT-PEM Fuel Cell is simpler than that of a LT-PEM Fuel Cell. It mainly 
consists in delivering air at the required flow rate and pressure (no humidification required), 
and to exhaust the depleted air containing water steam. A typical air subsystem is comprised of 
the following components: 

•  Air compressor or blower that delivers the air to correct pressure and flow; 

•  A back-pressure regulator to maintain sufficient pressure inside the stack; 

•  As for the LT-PEM, air independent systems are possible and would be similar to those 

described previously in section C.4.1. 

Pressurized, pure O2 could also be used. 

C.5.2  HT-PEM Fuel Delivery Subsystem 

As for the LT-PEM, H2 is required at the anode. In a HT-PEM Fuel Cell system, the fuel delivery 
subsystem usually comprises the followings: 

•  Pressure regulator to deliver fuel at the desired pressure 

•  Water separator to condense and separate out liquid water (optional) 

•  Purge valve to close and open the anode circuit in order to evacuate the water steam from 

the reaction 

C.5.3  HT-PEM Thermal Management Subsystem 

As for the LT-PEM, an HT-PEM requires the generated heat to be removed. The thermal 
management subsystem is also used to heat-up the fuel cell stack during start-up phase. The 
main components are: 

•  Coolant pump and thermostatic valve system to provide the required coolant flow rate 

within the fuel cell stack and within the heat exchanger 

•  Coolant radiator to exchange the heat to be evacuated with a cold sink such as air from the 
exterior or any other fluid in order to recover and valorize the rejected heat from the fuel 
cell stack 

•  Coolant heater to heat-up the coolant and the fuel cell stack during start-up phase of the 
fuel cell stack; the coolant heater can also be a heat exchanger to recover heat from 
another system of the aircraft 

As the heat generated by the HT-PEM Fuel Cell Stack is comprised between 120°C and 180°C, 
the temperature difference with the cold source is greater than in the case of a Low 
Temperature PEM Fuel Cell Stack which temperature is below 100°C. The result is that the 

72 

 
coolant radiator is of a smaller size as the required exchange surface is less. The cold source 
flow rate required (air as an example) is also less which results in reduced parasitic losses. 

C.5.4  HT-PEM Electrical Power Outlet: Power Management Subsystem 

As with LT-PEM Fuel Cells, the main purpose of the power management subsystem is to collect 
the current/voltage that the fuel cell stack outputs to: provide power main load and to power 
the balance of plant components within the fuel cell system. 

C.5.5  HT-PEM FC Monitor and Control 

As with LT-PEM Fuel Cells, the fuel monitoring and control system should provide two main 
functions:  provide control interlocks to ensure safe operation and prevent damage to the 
system on shutdown; and provide operating state control to enable start-up and shut-down 
sequence and fault responses. 

C.5.6  HT-PEM Exhaust Conditioning 

•  HT-PEM fuel cell stacks generate water in the form of steam. In an environment where 

temperatures get below freezing, especially while the fuel cell is not running, designs must 
clear the system of water or be water freeze tolerant to avoid events that lead to failure of 
the fuel cell stacks. The removal of water in the form of steam is eased-up compared to the 
case of liquid water as in the case of LT-PEM fuel cell. 

•  Water is produced in the form of steam. This could be usable in in other aircraft systems. 

•  Some HT-PEM system designs need to purge the anode exhaust that contains H2. As such, a 

safe venting path for the exhaust is required. 

•  Due to Phosphoric acid doping, exhaust acidity, and therefore, corrosivity should be taken 

into consideration for material selection. 

C.5.7  HT-PEM Enclosure 

The HT-PEM fuel cell stack and some of the sub-systems may be packaged in an enclosure.  The 
enclosure must provide:  maintenance access; ventilation inlet; ventilation outlet; and/or 
ingress protection against environmental elements such as dust, dirt or water.  Hydrogen gas 
leak detection is also needed and system and fuel supply shut-down should occur if a detection 
occurs. 

C.5.8  HT-PEM Startup and Shutdown 

As for LT-PEM FC systems, exact details of start-up and shut-down sequence are considered 
proprietary. However, in general, start-up and shutdown strategies are designed to enable the 
safe start and shutdown of a fuel cell, and to mitigate against conditions that lead to failure 
modes within the PEM fuel cell stack. Dependent on the PEMFC design, purging events during 

73 

 
startup and shutdown may be required to clear the stack of inert gases. This could require some 
additional system interface or design features, especially if the system is in the pressurized 
hull/passenger compartment (to make sure there are no issues with those gases in the 
passenger compartment). 

C.5.9  HT-PEM Airframe Integration Considerations for High Temperature PEM Fuel Cells 

High Temperature PEM Fuel Cells have slightly different inherent operational characteristics 
compared to LT-PEM Fuel Cell, which should be considered for airframe integration: 

•  HT-PEM FC’s operate at temperature of 120°C to 180°C. This could be usable in other 

aircraft systems. 

•  Water is produced in the form of steam. This could be usable in other aircraft systems. 

•  Some HT-PEM system designs need N2 to use during shutdown.  As such, the addition of N2 

pressurized gas bottle would be needed for this type of system design. 

•  Some HT-PEM system designs need to purge the anode exhaust. As such, a safe venting 

path for the exhaust is required. 

•  HT-PEM FC’s need to reject about 1 kW of heat for every kW in electric. Need to provide a 
coolant subsystem at temperature comprised between 120°C and 180°C and radiator to 
reject the heat. Designs need to provide adequate area for a radiator or a heat exchanger 
and a location to allow the heat to be rejected or recovered for valorization. 

•  The time for a HT-PEM fuel cell stack to produce power depends of its initial temperature 
and varies from few seconds (if initially above 100°C) to few minutes (if initially below 
100°C) and the power can be generated as soon as reactants gases are supplied to the 
stack.  If the HT-PEM fuel cell stack is started below freezing conditions, additional time is 
required to warm up and prepare the stack to have access to the reactant gases. 

•  HT-PEM fuel cell stacks generate water in the form of steam. In an environment where 

temperatures get below freezing (while the fuel cell is not running) designs must clear the 
system of water or be water freeze tolerant to avoid events that lead to failure of the PEM 
fuel cell stacks. The removal of water in the form of steam is eased-up compared to the case 
of liquid water as in the case of LT-PEM fuel cell. 

C.5.10  HT-PEM Failure Modes 

Most failure modes of HT-PEM fuel cells are common to those of LT-PEM fuel cells. One of the 
major differences between HT and LT–PEM fuel cells is that HT-PEM fuel cells do not require 
hydration of the membrane to ensure proton conductivity as the proton carrier in the 
membrane is the phosphoric acid. As a consequence, the proton conductivity is not dependent 
on hydration of the membrane neither on an overheat situation triggering a drying of the 
membrane. The membrane material, PBI for Polybenzimidazole, has a very good thermal 
stability, allowing it to withstand high temperature peaks without breaking or cracking, 

74 

 
although functioning at temperature above 180°C will generally accelerate aging. In the case of 
a fuel-to-air transfer due to pinhole formation, the leaked fuel meets air in the cathodic 
catalytic region which enhances a catalytic combustion. The catalytic combustion forms water 
directly without producing electrons usable in the electrical circuit and generates heat. If the 
phenomenon is not stopped, it can bolt as the generated heat would increase the temperature 
locally and cause membrane material degradation and increasing leakage. 

In the case of high temperature PEM fuel cells, the coolant liquid is generally not water as the 
temperature is above 100°C. Different fluids being liquid in the range of 120°C to 180°C and 
more can be used as coolant. As an example, synthetic oils can be used. In case of leak of hot 
oil, it is necessary to collect the leaked product to prevent from ignition. 

  SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS 

Fuel cells are often characterized by their electrolyte material; the SOFC has a solid oxide or 
ceramic electrolyte capable of very high temperature operation (600°C to 800°C). Advantages 
of this class of fuel cells include high efficiency, long-term stability, fuel flexibility, and low 
emissions.  A SOFC cell consists of three bonded layers: a cathode, an anode, and a ceramic 
electrolyte separating the electrodes. Each electrode is a thin, porous, electronic (e-) conductor. 
Electrode porosity is required for gaseous diffusion between the electrode's outer surface and 
the electrode/electrolyte interface. The electrolyte is a thin, fully dense oxygen ion (O=) 
conductor, but not an electronic conductor. The electrolyte needs to be fully dense to prevent 
gaseous fuel from contacting air and burning. The cells in an SOFC can be either of a tubular 
configuration or a flat planar configuration. 

SOFCs can operate on hydrogen, CO, or reformed / processed hydrocarbon fuels.  In contrast to 
the low temperature fuel cells for which CO is a contaminant, SOFC can utilize both H2 and CO 
in the electrochemical reaction. (H2 and CO are produced by the coal gasification process and 
by reformation of hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, as discussed in more detail later in this 
section.)  Figure 27 illustrates the electrochemical physics of a SOFC operation. As shown, 
gaseous fuel flows across the outer surface of the porous anode, and H2 and/or CO molecules 
reach the anode/electrolyte interface by pore diffusion. The fuel-side electrochemical reactions 
occur at triple points, located at this interface. At a fuel-side triple point the electrolyte (oxygen 
ion donor), the anode (electronic conductor), and the pore (source of the H2 or CO molecule) 
meet. Oxygen ions (O=) are extracted from the electrolyte, and the following exothermic 
reactions occur: 

1[H2] + 1[O=] —> 1[H2O] + 2[e-] 

1[CO] + 1[O=] —> 1[CO2] + 2[e-] 

75 

 
Figure 27. Electrochemical (Cell) Physics of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell 

In the process, two electrons are transferred to the anode (negative electrode) for each H2 or 
CO molecule reacted, and the reaction products, H2O and CO2, diffuse back toward the outer 
surface of the porous anode, where they enter the fuel stream. 

A competing reaction to the CO electrochemical reaction is the so-called water-gas shift 
reaction, where CO reacts with H2O to form additional H2 and CO2. Both the shift reaction and 
the electrochemical reaction do occur but the shift reaction is a strong function of temperature 
with the tendency to shift towards the reaction products (H2 and CO2) as the temperature is 
decreased. (Water-gas shift reactors for PEM and PAFC operate in the 200 °C to 350 °C range in 
order to completely react the CO.) 

As also indicated in Figure 27, air flows across the outer surface of the cathode, and O2 reaches 
the cathode/electrolyte interface by pore diffusion. The air-side electrochemical reactions also 
occur at triple points, located at the cathode/electrolyte interface. (For the purpose of 
explanation, the assumption here is that the cathode is a pure electronic conductor. Cathodes 
with mixed conductivity–both electronic and ionic–are discussed later.) An air-side triple point 
is where the electrolyte (oxygen ion acceptor), the cathode (electronic conductor), and the pore 

76 

 
 
(source of O2) meet. At these sites, electrons are extracted from the cathode and the following 
O2 reduction reaction occurs: 

1[O2] + 4[e-] —> 2[O=] 

These oxygen ions enter and are transported through the electrolyte by solid state diffusion 
from the high oxygen-pressure side (i.e., the cathode/electrolyte interface) to the low oxygen-
pressure side (i.e., the anode/electrolyte interface). For each O2 molecule reacted at the 
cathode/electrolyte interface, four electrons are extracted from the cathode (positive 
electrode). At the low end of the SOFC operating temperature range (650 °C to 700 °C), the 
ability to electrochemically reduce O2 is poor for pure electronic-conducting cathodes, which 
contributes to poor cell performance. So, cathodes having mixed conductivity (oxygen ion and 
electronic) have been under development for a number of years. Such cathodes improve the 
electro-catalytic activity of the O2 reduction reaction, particularly at low temperatures, by 
increasing the number of sites for the reaction to occur 

Because of the reactions at both interfaces and the oxygen ion conductivity of the electrolyte, 
electrons are transported from the cathode to the anode and a potential difference (voltage) is 
generated. When the anode is connected to the cathode through an external circuit, as shown 
in Figure 27, current will continue to flow as long as air flow, fuel flow, and cell temperature are 
maintained. If the cell temperature drops too low (e.g., below ~650 °C), the electrolyte oxygen 
ion conductivity as well as the air side electro-catalytic activity will become very small, resulting 
in unacceptably poor cell performance. In addition to being the source of oxygen for the 
electrochemical reaction, air flow on the cathode side is used to control cell temperatures by 
removing the thermal energy released during the fuel electrochemical reactions. 

As discussed previously, SOFC can utilize both H2 and CO in its electrochemical reaction. 
However, hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, etc.) in fuels such as natural gas and coal-derived fuel gas 
(referred to as syngas) must first be reformed (i.e., reacted with steam) to produce H2 and CO 
prior to the fuel side electrochemical reaction. Because of its high operating temperature, the 
SOFC is particularly well suited for hydrocarbon reformation. The reformation temperature for 
methane (CH4) at 1 atm. pressure must be greater than ~700 °C for the endothermic (i.e., 
cooling) reformation reaction to go to completion according to: 

1[CH4] + 1[H2O] —> 3[H2] + 1[CO] 

Nickel is an excellent catalyst for this reaction. Therefore, the cell's anode, which contains 
nickel, can be used as the catalyst as long as the resultant cell temperature gradients due to this 
endothermic reaction can be kept in the acceptable range. This is called on-cell reformation or 
direct internal reformation. Being endothermic, the direct internal reformation process can 
have the beneficial effect of reducing the air flow requirement for cell cooling, thereby reducing 
system cost (smaller heat exchanger, main air blower, ducting, etc.), and improving system 
electrical efficiency (reduced air pumping power). 

77 

 
  SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS 

Figure 28 illustrates a simple piping and instrumentation system configuration based on 
hydrocarbon fuel as the fuel source. 

Figure 28. General Solid Oxide Fuel Cell System Piping and Instrumentation Diagram 

Due to the higher temperatures, a SOFC usually is staged with lower temperature components 
grouped external, and higher temperature components grouped internal, to a thermally 
insulated area.  The SOFC has many of the same functions as other fuel cell technologies.  The 
system above shows the SOFC operating with a reformer, as would be the case if using a higher 
hydrocarbon based fuel (e.g., on an aircraft).  If the SOFC is operating directly on hydrogen or 
CO, then no reformer is needed.  A detailed discussion of fuel reformation is provided in 
Appendix D, section D.8, Reformer. 

A more detailed example of an SOFC system with reformer is shown in Figure 29. 

78 

 
 
Figure 29. Example SOFC with Desulfurizer and Reformer 

This system that can operate on a standard liquid fuel, which is one of the advantages of SOFC 
technology.  The fuel is first processed in the “HDS Desulfurization Module” to reduce the sulfur 
down to a level acceptable to SOFC technology.  Then, the resultant fuel is fed into the SOFC 
power module, which has similar functions to Figure 28. 

79 

 
 
C.7.1  SOFC Air Subsystem 

Like PEMFCs, every SOFC must have an air delivery subsystem.  The air subsystem must deliver 
the air at the required, flow, pressure, and temperature to the SOFC stack and exhaust the 
unutilized air.  Since SOFC operates at a very high temperature there is no membrane 
humidification.  An SOFC air subsystem has similar components such as blowers or 
compressors, but the thermal aspect of air handling becomes more important.  SOFC systems 
must include heat exchangers or heaters to bring the incoming flow up to SOFC operating 
conditions.  Most SOFCs use the waste heat from the electrochemical reaction to heat up 
incoming reactant flows. 

C.7.2  SOFC Fuel Delivery Subsystem 

The fuel delivery system running on pure hydrogen must supply the fuel cell stack with the 
correct pressure, flow; and temperature for operation.  Again, for SOFC technology the use of 
regenerative heat exchangers is critical.  Waste heat is generally used on the fuel side to heat 
up incoming flows. 

The fuel delivery system running on liquid fuel is more complex as shown in Figure 29.  It 
requires a number of processing steps to change the chemical form of the fuel from a complex 
hydrocarbon to the H2 and CO that is generally required for the stack.  A part of this system will 
need insulation around it to keep it at the appropriate operating temperature without loss of 
efficiency. 

C.7.3  SOFC Stack 

The stack is composed of several electrochemical cells.  The basic cell was described in 
Figure 27.  The cells have a passage for the fuel and oxidant and a means to conduct current.  
The cells either contain manifolds to route reactants and products to and from each cell or use 
external manifolds generally bonded to the stack.  The stack should be insulated, or headed, to 
assist keeping it at operating temperature. 

C.7.4  SOFC Exhaust Subsystem 

High temperature SOFC stacks produce water as the main exhaust product, in steam form.  
Other exhaust products include unutilized air coming from the cathode; unutilized H2/fuel 
coming from the anode; and other hot gas products like CO and CO2 (if utilizing other types 
fuel, like natural gas).  See Appendix D for the utilization of other types of fuel reactants. 

Normally, output exhaust temperatures are at least 200°C to 300°C. The exhaust (such as 
unutilized H2, air, steam, or fuel reformation products) can be also be recirculated, for usage, 
back into the SOFC/reformer. As mentioned before, the heated product can be used to heat up 
incoming reactants through the usage of regenerative heat exchangers. 

80 

 
If no recirculation or exhaust burner is being utilized, either a fan or a vent stack should be used 
to help dissipate the H2/fuel reactant (to help ensure it stays below the flammability limit). If a 
reformed fuel is being used, provisions to deal with the potential leakage of CO & CO2, which 
can create a toxic atmosphere, need to be addressed in the subsystem design.  If CO2 is 
contained in the exhaust, it should either be vented, or some sort of high temp CO2 scrubber 
should be used.  Any hazardous gasses that might be contained within the exhaust should be 
vented out of the aircraft. 

C.7.5  SOFC Coolant Subsystem 

In most SOFC systems the incoming air and fuels absorb heat from the stack and the streams 
are used to reject the heat to ambient.  A cooling system like the one used in the PEM FC is 
usually not needed for an SOFC stack, but some cooling may be needed for supporting system 
components (i.e. control electronics, power converters).  Because of the high temperature of 
the system, it is possible to use the rejected heat from an SOFC system for other applications.  
The heat exchangers can be smaller than those required for PEM fuel cells. 

C.7.6  SOFC Power Management Subsystem 

The power management subsystem of an SOFC is similar to other fuel cell technologies. 

C.7.7  SOFC Startup and Shutdown 

SOFC’s require a longer startup time due to high temperature operation and use of a ceramic 
based electrolyte.  There is no “cold start” capability as the electrolytes do not become 
electrochemically active until higher temperatures.  A heat source, such as electrical heating or 
combustive heating, is required to bring the SOFC up to operating temperature.  Also, most 
planar SOFC systems require a controlled temperature ramp up and down as to not thermally 
shock the stack.  Larger SOFC systems could take hours to start-up and cooldown.  SOFCs need 
to be shut down in a manner that will maintain a desired cool-down rate of the system.  This 
may often include ensuring any purge gases flowed to a SOFC stack during startup and 
shutdown are kept at low flow rates to maintain a slower rate of heat-up/cool-down. 

C.7.8  SOFC Airframe Integration Considerations 

•  SOFC operation at 600°C to 800°C. This is likely only usable outside the cabin pressurized 
volume. Designs need to account for adequate heating of reactants to SOFC operating 
temperature.  SOFC systems operate above the auto-ignition temperature of hydrogen, 
meaning that leakages internal to the stack would instantly react and produce heat instead 
of building up to an explosive mixture. 

•  SOFC’s need to reject about 1 kW of heat for every 1 kW of electrical power produced. Most 
of this heat may be directly exhausted but also may be used for other purposes.  Designs 
need to provide adequate area in a location that allows heat to be rejected. 

81 

 
• 

If the SOFC is operating on a reformed fuel, then gas handling/ventilation requirements 
would have to be in place for CO and CO2. 

•  Thermal cycling (heat up and cooldown from ambient temperature to operational 
temperature) currently impacts the operational life of SOFCs more than PEMFCs. 

•  Shock and vibration could be a concern for the ceramic membranes without adequate 

vibration protection. 

C.7.9  SOFC Failure Modes 

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells have many advantages embedded in their usage; however; they also 
include disadvantages or failure modes in their operation.  For SOFCs one key aspect is the 
structural integrity of the cell and hence its thermo-mechanical long-term behavior. 

Failure modes generally are categorized as: 

•  SOFCs should not be thermally ramped and cooled more than necessary, since multiple 

thermal cycles can limit the operating life of SOFCs.  A typical limit may be no more than 25 
cycles, although manufacturers are working to develop SOFC stacks capable of a higher 
number of thermal cycles.  There must be careful thermal management (Ramp-up, Ramp-
down, thermal cycle & system thermal equilibriums) during those cycles; this included delta 
inlet temperatures (cathode vs. anode), delta outlet temperatures (cathode vs. anode), 
maximum inlet temperatures (anode & cathode), and maximum outlet temperatures 
(anode & cathode). 

•  System Pressure: failure modes included reactant delta pressure (maximum) and reactant 
supply absolute pressure (maximum).  Generally, SOFCs cannot withstand large pressure 
differences across the cell as some other FC technologies (i.e. PEMFC) 

•  Flow rates: this involves reactant inlet flow rates (a limited range of rates).  SOFC cell 

materials can be degraded if they are not provided adequate reactants during operation. 

•  Reactants impurities: since a SOFC is capable of operating utilizing hydrocarbon fuels as a 

fuel source, impurities are another major failure mode. They can be harmful to the 
performance of SOFCs.  Some of these impurities include Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen 
chloride (HCl), and ammonia (NH3)4.  Some SOFC material sets are less sensitive to sulfur 
impurities than PEMFCs. 

•  Brittle fracture of Ceramic Electrolyte: Among all existing fuel cell technologies, the planar 
SOFC is the most promising one for high power density applications. A planar SOFC consists 
of two porous ceramic layers (the anode and cathode) through which flows the fuel and 
oxidant. These ceramic layers are bonded to a solid electrolyte layer to form a tri-layer 
structure consists of positive-electrolyte-negative across, which the electrochemical 
reactions take place to generate electricity. Because SOFCs operate at high temperatures,

the cell components (e.g., tri-layer and seals) are subjected to harsh environments and 
severe thermomechanical residual stresses. Under combined thermomechanical, electrical 
and chemical driving forces, stack failure can occur suddenly due to material fracture or loss 
of adhesion at the material interfaces. 

•  Oxidation: oxidation is based on what catalyst materials are used in SOFC cell construction. 

•  SOFCs also contain other material-related failure modes, such as when using certain 

interconnects (the connections between neighboring fuel cells).  For example, some metal 
interconnects can tend to form oxide coatings, which can limit their electrical conductivity 
and act as a barrier to mass transport5.  SOFC seals can sometimes fail, especially glass 
seals. The failures can involve the migration of silica from glass seals, sometimes onto the 
anodes and cathodes, causing a degradation in cell performance. 

As SOFC stacks reach the end of their lives, there are a few indicators that can help identify this 
point.  One indicator is the level of cell voltages being measured from the fuel cell stack, 
especially during use.  When cell voltages begin to drop below the expected range when a 
power load is demanded from the fuel cell, this serves as a sign of performance loss. Another 
signal of an approaching end of life for a SOFC, are irregular temperature readings.  For 
example, temperature readings are significantly above the expected range, this may indicate 
uneven reactant distribution (or in the case of internal steam reformation – uneven 
reformation distribution) within the SOFC stack.  Another indication of an approaching end of 
fuel cell life, are lower than expected reactant usage readings.  This may indicate leaks that 
have started to develop in an SOFC system. 

  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PEM AND SOFCS 

The following is provided to provide some of the important aspects of PEM and SOFC 
electrochemistries that must be addressed in order to move the technology forward so that it 
could be considered for use in aviation.  This information is based on data provided by NASA. 

•  Terrestrial and aerospace fuel cells have demonstrated gH2/gO2 operation in many short-

term demonstrations since the 1970’s using a wide range of electrochemistries. 

o  The electrochemistries demonstrated include alkaline, phosphoric acid, polymer 

electrolyte membranes (PEM), and ceramic solid oxide chemistries. 

o  Documented handling issues associated with liquid electrolytes eliminated alkaline 
and phosphoric acid chemistries from a NASA fuel cell technology trade study 
leaving only the PEM and solid oxide chemistries as viable candidates for use in 
aviation.

•  There is a critical lack of PEM life/durability data to extrapolate system performance over 
projected mission duration.  However, PEMFCs are the electrochemistry of choice for FC 
powered automobiles. 

Operating a PEM fuel cell in a vehicle, the PEMFC stack has an estimated service life of 
2,000–4,000 hours. Wetting and drying caused by short distance driving contributes to 
membrane stress. Running continuously, the stationary stack is good for about 40,000 
hours. The stack does not die suddenly but fades similar to a battery. Stack replacement 
is a major expense6. 

o  Life/durability is application and operation dependent 
o  For some space applications PEM fuel cell stack has been rated and tested up to 

30,000 hours of operation 

•  There is a critical lack of Solid Oxide life/durability data to extrapolate system performance 

over projected mission duration 

Electric utilities use three types of fuel cells, which are molten carbonate, phosphoric 
acid and solid oxide fuel cells. Among these choices, the solid oxide (SOFC) is the least 
developed, but it has received renewed attention because of breakthroughs in cell 
material and stack design. Rather than operating at the very high operating temperature 
of 800–1,000°C (1,472–1,832°F), a new generation of ceramic material has brought the 
core down to a more manageable 500–600°C (932–1,112°F). This allows the use of 
conventional stainless steel rather than expensive ceramics for auxiliary parts.  

High temperature allows direct extraction of hydrogen from natural gas through a 
catalytic reforming process. Carbon monoxide, a contaminant for the PEM, is a fuel for 
the SOFC. Being able to accept carbon-based fuels without a designated reformer and 
delivering high efficiency poses significant advantages for this type of fuel cell. 
Cogeneration by running steam generators from the heat by-product raises the SOFC to 
60 percent efficiency, one of the highest among fuel cells. As a negative, high stack 
temperature requires exotic materials for the core that adds to manufacturing costs and 
reduces longevity.7   

Bloom Energy’s Bloom Box SOFC stationery power systems are estimating the current 
units will have a 10-year life as long as the fuel-cell stacks are swapped out twice. 
However, there are currently no operational solid oxide fuel cell systems that have 
approached this age8.

 FUELS AND OXYGEN 

  INTRODUCTION 

The fuel and oxygen options play an important factor in the integration of a fuel cell system into 
an aircraft.  A PEMFC requires pure hydrogen to be supplied as a gas.  Impurities in the fuel 
stream can lead to rapid degradation.  Whereas SOFCs can be supplied with a lower purity fuel 
containing a mix of H2, CO2, CO and other trace gases without performance issues.  This 
reactant stream can come from a reformer that uses hydrocarbon/aircraft fuels, converting it 
into a reactant stream usable by the SOFC.  The latter system allows for operations that are not 
much different than what is currently done for an aircraft.  On the other hand, as described in 
Appendices B and C, the SOFC system is more complex than that PEMFC system. 

This appendix will look at the fuel and oxygen sources for the SOFC and PEMFC, and will include 
reformer technology descriptions.  Fuel storage and oxygen sources are discussed. Each section 
includes a summary of failure modes. 

Hydrogen fuel storage introduces some unique concerns.  The considerations and means to 
mitigate H2 storage risks are also discussed in the following sections. 

  FUEL SOURCES 

D.2.1  Pressurized Hydrogen Gas 

Hydrogen gas can be stored in a compressed-gas tank at high pressures to improve energy 
density. Pressure is typically 35 MPa (5000 psi) for mobile applications. Although storage of 
pressure of 70 MPa (10,000 psi) is also used. Higher pressures require material and design 
improvements to ensure tank integrity. 

The cost of H2 storage vessels is essentially dictated by cost of the carbon fiber that must be 
used for lightweight structural reinforcement. Compressed hydrogen tanks of 35 MPa and 70 
MPa have been demonstrated in several prototype FC vehicles and are commercially available, 
although these are vehicle and not aircraft applications. 

Four types of high pressure storage vessels are discussed in this appendix based on their 
sufficient level of maturity and their current use in other industrial areas such as chemical 
industries or hydrogen mobility’s applications (e.g., cars, forklift). 

Gas pressure vessels can be divided into Types I, II, III and IV and each are discussed in the 
following paragraphs.  Refer to Figure 30. 

87 

 
Figure 30. Hydrogen Storages Vessel Types 

D.2.2  Type I Pressure Vessels 

Type I Pressure vessels are metal cylinders typically constructed of steel or aluminum. This kind 
of technology is heavy and commonly used for industrial and stationary applications at relative 
low pressure (<20 MPa or 2900 psi). 

D.2.3  Type II Pressure Vessels 

Type II Pressure vessels are metal cylinders with filament windings such as glass fiber or carbon 
fiber around the cylindrical portion (hoop wrapped). This kind of technology is also heavy and 
commonly used for industrial and stationary applications at low to high pressure (< 100 MPa or 
14,500 psi). 

Type I and II Pressure vessels have volumetric and gravimetric capacities that are too limited for 
aeronautical application. 

D.2.4  Type III Pressure Vessels 

The most advanced lightweight storage system for the case of compressed gas consists of a 
vessel, which is an advanced composite tank using a metallic (Type III), shown in Figure 31, or 
plastic (Type IV) liner and fully wrapped with resin impregnated continuous filaments. 

88 

 
 
Figure 31. Type III Pressure Vessel 

The structure of these two types is based on two fundamental components: the liner, 
essentially a barrier for hydrogen permeation, and the composite structure that ensures the 
mechanical integrity of the tank. 

Below is a description of a Type III vessel: 

The liner of a Type III vessel is generally built with aluminum and is part of its mechanical 
integrity. The fiber full wrap is generally built with resin and carbon fiber. Type III Pressure 
vessels are composite cylinders with fiberglass or carbon fiber full wrap with a metallic liner. 

A Type III pressure vessel exhibits: 

•  Good gravimetric capacity (35 MPa or 5000 psi) or lower gravimetric capacity (70 MPa or 

10000 psi) 

•  Low volumetric capacity (35 MPa or 5000 psi) or high volumetric capacity (70 MPa or  

10000 psi) 

•  No (very low) hydrogen permeation rate thank to the metallic liner 

•  Limited pressure cycling capability 

•  Possible liner corrosion due to the liner material being metallic 

Pressure vessels must be adequately qualified for the environment they are installed in, and 
equipped with protective devices to prevent excessive pressure and consequent risk of rupture. 
The protective devices are required to prevent excessive pressure in the system and adequate 
countermeasures must be available to keep the pressure at a level which does not lead to 
unacceptable leakage. 

Protective devices, depending on the installation, could be pressure relief devices (PRD), 
rupture disc, or a thermally activated pressure relief device (TRD). 

89 

 
 
Pressure vessels installed inside the equipment must be adequately certified. The type III vessel 
certification could be defined using the standards listed below: 

•  EC 79-2009 EU H2 Regulation 

• 

ISO 15869 Gaseous Hydrogen and Hydrogen Blends 

•  SAE J 2579 Compressed Hydrogen Vehicle Fuel Containers 

• 

• 

ISO11119 Gas cylinders—Refillable composite gas cylinders and tubes 

ISO 11114 Gas cylinders 

•  DOT CFFC until 5000psi (344 bar) (For information, the oxygen cylinders currently used in 

aircraft are DOT certified). 

•  European Union (EU) Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive (TPED) Directive 

2010/35/EU 

•  EU Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) 2014/68/EU 

D.2.5  Type IV Pressure Vessels 

A Type IV pressure vessel is shown in Figure 32. 

Figure 32. Type IV Pressure Vessel 

The liner of a Type IV vessel is generally built with high density polymer.  This liner represents a 
hydrogen diffusion barrier and is not significantly part of the vessel’s mechanical integrity. 

90 

 
 
 
The fiber full wrap is generally built with carbon fiber composite shell and induces the 
mechanical strength. Type IV Pressure vessels are composite cylinders with fiberglass or carbon 
fiber full wrap with a polymer liner. 

Type IV 700 bar (70 MPa or 10000 psi) exhibits: 

•  Good gravimetric and volumetric capacities 
•  Significant pressure cycling capability 
•  Possible hydrogen permeation due to polymer liner material 
•  Possible liner clogging because of permeation and hydrogen trapped between the liner and 

the composite wrap 

•  Limited operating temperature range 

Pressure vessels must be adequately qualified for the environment they are installed in and 
equipped with protective devices to prevent excessive pressure and consequent risk of rupture. 
The protective devices are required to prevent excessive pressure in the system and adequate 
countermeasures must be available in order to keep the pressure at a level which does not lead 
to an unacceptable leakage. 

Protective devices, depending on the installation, could be pressure relief devices (PRD) or 
thermally activated pressure relief device (TRD). 

The pressure vessels which will be installed inside the equipment have to be adequately 
certified. 

The Type IV vessel certification could be defined using actual standards listed below: 

•  EC 79-2009 EU H2 Regulation 

• 

ISO 15869 Gaseous Hydrogen and Hydrogen Blends 

•  SAE J 2579 COMPRESSED HYDROGEN VEHICLE FUEL CONTAINERS 

• 

• 

ISO11119 Gas cylinders—Refillable composite gas cylinders and tubes 

ISO 11114 Gas cylinders 

•  DOT not applicable for Type 4 cylinders (For information, the oxygen cylinders currently 

used in aircrafts are DOT certified). 

•  EU Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive (TPED) Directive 2010/35/EU 

•  EU Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) 2014/68/EU 

  COMPRESSED HYDROGEN STORAGE SYSTEM (CHSS) 

The Compressed Hydrogen Storage System (CHSS) is a system which is used to store H2 at high 
pressure and to supply it, in safe and reliable conditions to the Fuel Cell Module (FCM) at low 
pressure. This system contains components which ensure dedicated functions to fill, store, and 

91 

 
supply the hydrogen for a fuel cell application. A picture of an onboard CHSS is shown in 
Figure 33: 

Figure 33. Onboard Compressed Hydrogen Storage System (CHSS) Schematic 

A Compressed Hydrogen Storage System consists of: 

•  Pressure vessel (Type III or IV depending of the application); 

•  Relief devices components: 

o  Pressure Relief Device (or eventually rupture discs) activated by an overpressure 
o  Temperature Relief Device activated by an over-temperature 

•  Solenoid Control Valve (SOV) (Normally Closed) to close the H2 supply if a problem has been 

detected (H2 leak or other) 

•  Primary Pressure Regulator (1st stage) to transform high pressure to low pressure so as to 

avoid high pressure in the FCM, (in this configuration, a second pressure regulator (2nd stage 
for pressure adjustment), is requested in the FCM) 

•  Pressure Safety Valve to avoid high pressure in the FCM 

•  Regulation valves (check valves) 

•  Refueling interface 

92 

 
 
•  H2 Low Pressure Quick Connector to FC system 

•  Filters to protect components from impurities 

•  Piping, Fittings 

•  Sensors (Pressure Transmitter, Temperature Transmitter) 

•  H2 Detection to detect potential leaks and to close the SOV if required 

•  Electrical equipment and electric wiring 

D.3.1  CHSS Components: Standards and Certifications 

The components which will be installed inside the CHSS must be adequately qualified for the 
environment they are installed in and compliant with H2 operation. 

SAE J2579 H2 Storage Systems for Vehicles could be used as a guide. 

The components which will be installed inside the CHSS must be compliant with an explosive 
atmosphere to prevent fire ignition with consequent risk of explosion. The explosive 
atmosphere compliance section of this report will cover the ignition risk in case of Medium 
leakage (refer to section D.3.3). 

IEC 60079 Explosive atmospheres could be used as a guide. 

D.3.2  Refueling Protocol Compressed Hydrogen 

A specific refueling interface and fueling protocol will have to be done depending the 
application considered (Galley, APU, or other) and depending on the fuel considered (High 
Pressure 350 or 700 bar). 

The documents listed below could be used as a guide. 

• 

• 

• 

ISO 23273:2013 Fuel cell road vehicles -- Safety specifications -- Protection against hydrogen 
hazards for vehicles fueled with compressed hydrogen 

ISO 17268, Gaseous hydrogen land vehicle refueling connection devices 

ISO 20100 - Gaseous hydrogen — Fueling stations 

•  SAE J-2601 - Fueling Protocols for Light Duty Gaseous Hydrogen Surface Vehicles (also 

includes 70 MPa possibility) 

•  SAE J-2799 – (for 70 MPa) – requires also special fueling protocols (reference SAE J-2601) 

D.3.3  CHSS Failure Modes 

CHSS failure modes can include: 

•  Hydrogen Fire 

93 

 
•  Hydrogen Supply interruption 
•  Monitoring failure 

These failures will be addressed in Appendix F, Hazards, in terms of impact to aircraft, and what 
design considerations are necessary to mitigate the consequences of CHSS failures. 

Leakage rates, per ANSI/AIAA G-095-2004, are defined in relation to the Lower Flammability 
Limit (LFL) of H2 as follows: 

•  Low Leakage:  Low leakage is an amount of leaking fuel which leads to a fuel 
concentration in a fuel/air mixture below 25% of the LFL (1% volumetric H2 
concentration). No safety issues. 

•  Medium Leakage:  Medium leakage is as an amount of leaking fuel which leads to a fuel 

concentration in a fuel/air mixture between 25% and 50% of the LFL (1% to 2% 
volumetric H2 concentration). 

•  Probability of occurrence of a medium external leakage and failure of the corresponding 
active protection means must remain below 10-9 per flight hour. The medium H2 leakage 
may lead to a very localized H2 concentration between LFL and Higher Flammability 
Limit (HFL). 

• 

• 

Indeed, due to the concentration gradient between 100% directly at the leak and 1% to 
2% in the surrounding area, any H2 leakage leads to local H2 concentration between LFL 
and HFL in the immediate vicinity of the leak. 

In the corresponding (relatively small) volume must be demonstrated that the 
probability of ignition of such a mixture is below 10-9 per flight hour, unless it can be 
demonstrated that the ignition of the highest expected flammable mixture's volume 
does not lead to any safety issue. 

•  High Leakage:  High leakage is as an amount of leaking fuel which leads to a fuel 

concentration above 50% of the LFL (>2% volumetric H2 concentration). Probability of 
occurrence of a high external leakage shall remain below 10-9 per flight hour. 

D.3.4  CHSS Intrinsic and External Risks 

There are several intrinsic risks that include: 

•  Vessel Burst (overpressure induced or not by over temperature) 

•  H2 Leakage leading to potentially explosive atmosphere 

•  H2 embrittlement (refer to Material compatibility chapter (ISO11114)) 

•  Static Electricity creating ignition in potentially explosive atmosphere 

There are several external risks that include: 

•  Fire 

94 

 
•  Electrical ignition sources: 

•  Electrical short circuits, sparks, and arcs. 

•  Lightning. 

•  HIRF 

•  EMI 

•  Electro Static Discharge 

•  Thermal Sources: 

o  Hot Surfaces 
o  Frictions/contacts 

•  Vibrations 

•  Shocks 

•  Contamination: e.g. fluid leakages 

•  Accidental damage/Foreign Object Damage (FOD) 

CHSS intrinsic and external risks will be addressed in Appendix F, Hazards, in terms of impact to 
aircraft, and system designs to be considered in the future will need to address means for 
mitigation. 

  LIQUID HYDROGEN 

Hydrogen can be stored in a liquid form at low temperature and relatively low pressures to 
improve energy density compared to compressed hydrogen. The hydrogen temperature in its 
liquid form is below 20oK (-253oC) and is considered as a cryogenic temperature. 

Liquid Hydrogen is stored in its liquid state at a very low temperature of around 20K, so the 
tank must be designed with a specific cryogenic insulation to minimize heat leaks. Generally, 
liquid tanks are designed with an efficient Multi-Layer Insulation. Both the Inner Vessel and 
Outer jacket are usually made with metal (stainless steel or aluminum) and the space in 
between is filled with a multilayer insulation and then let under vacuum to enhance thermal 
insulation. 

The Inner Vessel containing the H2 mass is supported inside the Outer Jacket by means of 
Supports designed to reduce heat leaks and to withstand the requested mechanical loads. 

Based on the design shown in Figure 34, the Liquid Hydrogen tank design for mobile 
applications have similarities, but depend mostly of the application considered. The Liquid 
Hydrogen tank for trailers used on public roads for gas delivery for industrial applications do 
not have the same design than the Liquid Hydrogen tank used for spaceship propulsion. 
Therefore, each mobile application has its own specific design and is a mature technology. 

95 

 
Figure 34. Schematic View of a Typical Liquid Hydrogen Tank 

Mobile Liquid hydrogen tanks have already been demonstrated and validated in several 
prototypes of fuel cell vehicles but are not considered as commercially available. 

Liquid Hydrogen tanks exhibits: 

•  Good gravimetric capacity and high volumetric capacity 

•  Low pressure technology 

•  Mature technology for Mobile application 

D.4.1  Liquid Hydrogen Tank: Protective/Safety Devices 

The Liquid Hydrogen tank pressure is relatively low (generally < 12 bar) but the Liquid hydrogen 
tank is considered as a pressure vessel. 

Pressure vessels must be adequately qualified for the environment they are installed in and 
equipped with protective devices to prevent excessive pressure with consequent risk of 
rupture. The protective devices are required to prevent excessive pressure in the system and 
shall be such that adequate countermeasures are available to keep the pressure at a level 
which does not lead to a high leakage of the system. 

96 

 
 
Protective devices, depending on the installation, could be pressure relief devices (PRD) or 
rupture discs. 

Protective devices shall be used to provide over-pressure protection from burst if hydrogen is 
vaporized due to suddenly significant heat transfer as for example the loss of vacuum between 
the Inner vessel and the Outer Jacket. 

If necessary, redundant protective devices shall be used to ensure that boil-off can be vented 
and does not cause any over-pressure. 

D.4.2  Liquid Hydrogen Tank: Standard and Certifications 

The Liquid hydrogen tank which will be installed inside the equipment must be adequately 
certified.  Tank certification could be defined using the standards listed below:

and to supply it to the Fuel Cell Module (FCM) at low pressure and in safe and reliable 
conditions. This system contains components which ensure dedicated functions to refuel, store, 
and supply the hydrogen for the fuel cell application. 

The Liquid Hydrogen Storage System consists of: 

•  Liquid hydrogen tank (refer description above)

pressure

  SOLID HYDROGEN STORAGE 

Solid hydrogen storage usually provides hydrogen on demand at a low pressure and stored in a 
stable state.  This mitigates many of the issues related to the containment and delivery of 
hydrogen at high pressure or liquid form. 

100 

 
The storage volume of both gaseous and liquid hydrogen is limited by the physical density of 
hydrogen (700 bar gas 63g/l @0°C, Liquid 70g/l @20°K), however the density of hydrogen in a 
solid hydrogen storage material is not bounded by the properties of hydrogen but by properties 
of the storage material (a solid).  For example, the density of hydrogen in Lithium Borohydride 
(LiBH) is 123g/l, twice as dense as gaseous hydrogen at 700 bar pressure. 

Solid hydrogen storage refers to a number of techniques to store hydrogen within a host 
material. These fall into two broad categories; absorption as a chemical compound or 
absorption on materials (usually carbon-based materials). In terms of safety, these techniques 
leverage an advantage over either high pressure gaseous hydrogen storage or liquid storage as 
the hydrogen requires a conversion or energy input to release it from the storage material. 

The hydrogen is bonded by either physical forces (usually referred to as physisorption) or 
chemical forces (usually referred to as chemisorption), although the boundary between the two 
is sometimes blurred as some hydrogen storage techniques may fall into both categorizations. 
Physisorption tends to have faster adsorption / desorption and greater energy efficiency 
whereas chemisorption results in the absorption of larger volumes of gas although sometimes it 
is not reversible or may require high temperatures to release the absorbed gas. 

Examples are physisorption of hydrogen on materials with a high specific surface area are 
Activated Carbon (AC), Graphite Nanofiber (CNF), Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), Metal Organic 
Frameworks (MOFs), and doped polymers. 

Examples of chemisorption are hydrogen intercalation within host metals and metallic hydrides, 
desorption of hydrogen from complex compounds, and chemical oxidization of metals with 
water. 

D.6.1  Physisorption 

In order to store large quantities of hydrogen, viable materials need to be relatively light and 
have a large specific surface area. Physisorption, as depicted in Figure 36, is the phenomenon 
where gas molecules interact with several atoms at the surface of a solid and consist of an 
attractive interaction (Van der Waals) and a repulsive interaction between the hydrogen gas 
molecule and host molecule. Many materials are being studied at present with experimental 
results indicating the around 4% wt can be achieved. 

Figure 36. Physisorption Molecular Level Illustration 

101 

 
 
D.6.2  Chemisorption 

A much greater level of understanding exists of the processes involved in chemical reactions 
than that of physisorption, this has led to technologies at higher Technology Readiness Level9 
(TRL) being developed. The main types of Chemisorption processes are 
desorption/decomposition of hydrogen from complex compounds, chemical oxidization of 
metals with water, and hydrogen intercalation within host metals and metallic hydrides. 

The aim of the technology employed is to achieve a system weight and volume like that of 
700 bar gaseous hydrogen. 

Releasing hydrogen from hydrides either by decomposition or by a chemical reaction are the 
most promising solid storage technologies and are discussed in the following paragraphs.  There 
are other materials which can be used for solid hydrogen storage.  However, they are not 
discussed because of the infancy of those technology/techniques. 

D.6.3  Metal Hydrides 

Binary Hydrides contain a metallic element from the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal groups 
and hydrogen, these hydrides are what are commonly termed metal hydrides and is depicted in 
Figure 37. 

Figure 37. Metal Molecular Hydride Structure 

The structure is that of a typical metal, crystalline, with hydrogen in the interstitial sites, hence 
metal hydrides are also referred to as interstitial hydrides. They are ionic compounds, that is, 
the atoms are bound together by ionic attraction. 

9 Technology readiness levels (TRL) are a method of estimating technology maturity of Critical Technology 
Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. 

102 

 
 
                                                      
Complex metal hydrides contain more than one type of metal or metalloid, an example is 
Lithium Borohydride LiBH4. As is shown in Figure 38, the hydrogen is covalently bonded to the 
host material. 

Figure 38. Covalently Bonded LiBH4 Molecular Structure 

The hydrogen can be release from the hydride by either a chemical reaction and/or 
decomposition. 

Hydrides tend to form stable hydrides and therefore usually require quite a lot of energy to 
decompose, however, metal hydrides also readily react with water or acids. 

Releasing hydrogen by a chemical reaction involves adding one or more reactants. In the 
simplest form, a binary hydride will react with water to produce a hydroxide and hydrogen. 
Most reactions of this type are highly exothermic, consequently resulting in fast kinetics with 
high hydrogen production rates; however, they do suffer from controllability and/or 
containment and usually require excess heat to be managed. 

Appling energy heat to a hydride will break the bonds between the molecules thus releasing the 
hydrogen gas. This is commonly referred to as chemical decomposition, or simply 
decomposition. Clearly there is a relationship between the energy required to break the bonds 
and the stability of the hydride. Although the amount of energy is relatively high there are 
materials that decompose at temperatures close to, or below, ambient, or can be destabilized 
to reduce the energy requirements. The energy can be derived from several sources, for 
example waste heat, direct combustion of aviation fuel, or a parasitic load on the fuel cell. 

Other factors that influence the design of a solid hydrogen system include the storage 
chemical(s), recharging of the system or replacement of the spent fuel, disposal of the by-
products, control under the influence of an exceptional situation (for example an aircraft fire 
could decompose the material leading to hydrogen release).  Reactant containment in these off 
normal conditions would need to be evaluated.

  JET FUEL 

Jet fuel, or other hydrocarbon fuel options similar to jet fuel, as a source for fuel cells is still low 
in maturity.  Reformer technologies are still in development, and coupling the reformer to the 
fuel cell results in a complex system needing multiple steps to start up, and adds additional 
time and complexity to that startup.  The SOFC is the most likely early user of the reformer 
technology.  It can accept a wider spectrum of reformer product chemistries.  As discussed in 
Appendix B, section B.1.3, PEMFC need very pure H2 and is less likely to be able to use a 
reformer product. 

  REFORMER 

In general, hydrocarbon fuel is reformed to syngas (synthesis gas) before being fed to the fuel 
cell. Unless there is a reliable option for internal reforming within a SOFC stack (not available at 
the time of this report’s release), the fuel cell will need some form of external reformation.  
Steam reforming, auto thermal reforming, and partial oxidation are the most commonly used 
reaction technologies for producing syngas from hydrocarbon fuels. Each of these reforming 
technologies has received much attention in the research and patent literature.  Table 3 
provides a listing of the various reforming technologies discussed in Sections D.8.1 to D.8.4.

D.8.1  Steam Reforming 

Catalytic steam reforming (SR) of natural gas is one of the most energy efficient ways to 
produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  Steam reforming does not require the mixing of air in 
the reaction mixture and therefore produces higher H2 concentration in the reformed product. 
The elimination of oxygen from the initial fuel mixture improves the overall system efficiency by 
minimizing energy losses from catalytic combustion. Steam reforming does, however, require 
an external heat source due to the endothermic reactions that occur. This method for 
producing reformate can therefore only realize its advantage when effective heat utilization 
from the SOFC stack can be achieved. The cost of the conventional steam reforming catalysts is 
relatively low although they tend to be vulnerable to sulfur-based catalyst poisons.  Steam 
reforming technology is widely used in industrial syngas production at very large scale.

Potential hazards regarding Steam Reforming, include an insufficient steam-to-methane molar 
ratio, which can be a major contributing factor to carbon formation.  An insufficient ratio, can 
also impact the fuel conversion efficiency as well.  Additional hazards, include potential Carbon 
Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide gas leakage, which are produced because of the steam 
reformation reactions.  This could result in a toxic atmosphere environment.  And along with 
the aforementioned hazards, other related hazards which are included in the usage with a 
SOFC, are H2/fuel gas leakage (which could result in fire and oxygen deficiency hazards). 

D.8.2  Autothermal Reforming 

Autothermal reforming (ATR) presents a flexible choice, providing reasonable hydrogen and 
carbon monoxide yields. The process is catalytic and involves input streams of both air and 
water that will react with the fuel stream to produce syngas. Effectively, an ATR combines the 
exothermic nature of a partial oxidation reaction (hydrocarbon fuel reacting with air) with the 

106 

 
endothermic steam reforming reaction to balance the heat requirements. Reactions can occur 
on the same catalyst or on a steam reforming catalyst located in close proximity to the partial 
oxidation catalysts. The quality of the ATR reformate, defined in terms of hydrogen mole 
fraction, is superior to the catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) reformate but not as good as the SR 
reformate. The advantage, though, is that we would have a thermally neutral system 
component, more responsive than a SR reformer, moderate in cost, size and weight 
requirements. On the downside, a more extensive control system is needed for ATRs to ensure 
robust operation of the fuel processing system.

D.8.3  Catalytic Partial Oxidation Reforming 

Catalytic partial oxidation uses reaction technology where the hydrocarbon fuel is mixed with 
just enough oxygen to convert the carbon in the fuel to carbon monoxide. Fuel is reacted with 
air over a catalyst and the combustion is prevented from going to completion by controlling the 
amount of oxygen and residence time. Due to the fast reaction rates the CPOX reformer has 
short response times; these reactors are very compact and contact times are typically 
milliseconds. The CPOX system is comparatively more fuel flexible than SR or ATR and can 
tolerate higher levels of sulfur contaminants in the hydrocarbon fuels. Two disadvantages of 
this technology are the low hydrogen content and the high operating temperatures could lead 
to catalyst degradation.

D.8.4  Hydrodesulfurization 

Hydrodesulphurization (HDS) is used to remove Sulfur, from natural gas and other refined 
petroleum products.  This since sulfur can deactivate catalysts for various reformers, as well as 
the electrodes of SOFCs. Natural gas and petroleum liquids tend to contain organic sulfur 
compounds, which need to be removed. HDS requires a hydrogen rich stream to feed into the 
reactor, so it would not be ideally suited for internally reformed SOFCs, which don’t require a 
hydrogen-rich reactant stream.  But for SOFC systems that utilize external reformers, and thus 
produce hydrogen-rich input streams, a HDS reactor would be suitable.  From the hydrogen-rich 
gas produced by the external reformer, a small portion can be recycled back into a HDS reactor, 
as it is working to remove sulfur from the system. 

Often the reaction works by having the sulfur-containing compounds, flowed over a supported 
nickel-molybdenum oxide or cobalt-molybdenum oxide catalyst, and converted into hydrogen 
sulfide via hydrogenolysis reactions of the type: 

(C2H5)2S + 2H2 → 2C2H6 + H2S 

Though generally, the operating conditions and feed gas composition help determine the 
choice between using nickel or cobalt, as a catalyst.  And usually, this process is operated at 
300oC to 400oC, to optimize the rate of reaction.  And the H2S that is formed, is then normally 
absorbed into a bed of zinc oxide, creating zinc sulfide: 

H2S + ZnO → ZnS + H2O

  OXYGEN SOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL IMPACTS 

D.9.1  Role of Oxygen in the Fuel Cell Reaction and Aircraft Fuel Cell and Impacts 
on Environmental Control System, ECS, Design 

A fuel cell stack is an energy conversion device that converts potential energy stored in an 
external fuel into electrical energy, waste heat and reaction by-products. This is done via an 
electrochemical reaction that combines the fuel with an oxidizer. While other oxidizers such as 
chlorine or bromine can be used, for the purposes of this report it is assumed that the oxidizer 
for the fuel cell technology of interest is oxygen that is derived from stored sources or from 
ambient air. 

Oxygen is fundamental to the fuel cell operation. Both PEM and SOFC systems utilize O2 
supplied either directly as a pure gas or from air sources. The characteristics of varying sources 
can impact fuel cell operation. For example, in PEM fuel cells the oxygen electrode is highly 
affected by oxygen partial pressure (PP). Figure 40 illustrates this relationship (note this chart 
assumes both gases at the same PP but still illustrates the relationship). This is relevant since 
the O2 electrode is more sensitive to pressure than the H2 electrode for PEM fuel cells. In 
Figure 40, P1 of 0.4 roughly relates to a PO2 of ambient air in depressurization, P2 of 2.0 psia is 
roughly ambient PO2 at 10.9 psia and P3 represents bleed air PO2 assuming 40 psia bleed air.

Also in most but not all PEM fuel cells, oxygen flow or air flow is often used to remove water, 
which is a reaction product. Further, since fuel cell waste heat will most likely be rejected to the 
external environment, the air supply may be required to remove waste heat as well as provide 
oxygen. 

The following reviews likely sources of fuel cell oxygen, discusses consideration of the supply of 
oxygen from differing sources, and reviews thermal implications for various potential 
applications. These applications can include: 

•  Distributed Power, (e.g., galley fuel cell) 

•  Ram Air Turbine Replacement (RAT) 

•  Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Replacement 

• 

Isolated Systems (e.g., Palletized Medevac)

D.9.2  Current Sources of Oxygen in Aircraft 

Supply of oxygen for life support in pressurized transport aircraft is basic to their design. These 
aircraft typically operate at altitudes up to 45,000 feet and some have operated at over 
60,000 ft. Human life is not sustainable at these altitudes and an artificial atmosphere is vital. 
Normal breathing air oxygen is provided from the ambient air typically through systems that 
provide this through engine bleed air or in bleedless systems via environmental control system 
(ECS) compressors.  Refer to Figure 41. 

111 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 41. Typical Aircraft Engine Bleed Air System 

It should be noted that bleedless systems that provide pressurized air are increasingly utilized 
due to improvements in overall fuel consumption and simplification of engine buildup due to 
the elimination of the pneumatic system and associated pre-coolers, control valves, and 
required pneumatic ducting. 

All pressurized transport aircraft also provide pure oxygen for emergency or medical use. This is 
typically stored either as gaseous oxygen or in the form of chemicals that release oxygen when 
a reaction is initiated. Pilot oxygen systems typically utilize separate gaseous stored oxygen that 
can be supplied within seconds of a depressurization event. These systems are regulated under 
various FAA/SAE criteria.

D.9.3  Common Fuel Cell System Location Issues 

A primary consideration in system implementation is system location and its impact on O2 
supply and heat rejection.  The following briefly discusses these issues. 

D.9.4  Fuel Cell Systems External to Pressurized Area 

While some of the fuel cell systems being considered are assumed to be within the pressurized 
aircraft volume this is not the only suitable location. For example, a SOFC, designed as a drop-in 
APU replacement would likely be sited outside the pressurized area (Figure 42). Due to the 
highly efficient O2 electrode it would not suffer unacceptable performance loss due to low O2 
PP and a location outside the pressurized area would be more suitable when considering 
operation of an extremely high temperature device. 

113 

 
Figure 42. Conceptual Fuel Cell Design for APU Applications 

(external to the pressurized area) 

The emergency power system will also likely be external to the pressurized area.  It is unlikely 
that this system could be an SOFC due to start up transient limitations.  The PEMFC could be 
used in this application, and start up would be near instantaneous with pressurized H2 and O2.  
Some forms of chemical O2 could be used, but the system design would have to take the 
chemical generation start up in account. 

D.9.5  Thermal Issues Related to Fuel Cell Systems Fully Contained within Pressurized 
Volume 

If 100% of the heat from the fuel cell is rejected within the pressurized volume the impact can 
be considerable when compared to the thermal load from the passengers. 

The average heat generation by a comfortable, sedentary person, excluding heat loss due to 
evaporation of moisture, is about 70 W (ASHRAE 1997b). The total heat load in an aircraft cabin 
will include heat loads from electronics and heat gain through the aircraft skin. Including these 
heat sources, the total heat load can reasonably be taken as twice the occupant-generated 
amount, or 140 W/person. If the cabin temperature is kept in the middle of the ASHRAE 
“comfort envelope” (ASHRAE 1992) at 23 °C and the air is supplied to the cabin at 10 °C, the 
equation below can be used to determine the required rate of flow of conditioned air to the 
cabin: 

114 

 
 
23°C=10°C+(140/m)(1/1,000)=>m =0.0108 kg/s·person= 0.646 kg/min·person 

That is, adequate temperature control in the cabin requires that conditioned air be supplied to 
the cabin at about 0.65 kg/min (1.4 lb/min) per person to maintain a comfortable temperature. 
This requirement is more than twice the CFR part 25 requirement of 0.25 kg/min per person for 
outside air and provides one rationale for recirculating cabin air (see section on recirculation). 

By comparison, a 10kW fuel cell or set of fuel cells will generate approximately 10,000 watts of 
heat or the equivalent of 143 passengers.  This may impose a considerable demand on the ECS 
design or require separate heat rejection not coupled to the ECS. 

In addition to thermal considerations, decisions related to various combinations of fuel and 
oxidizer sources also may impact ECS design and are discussed below. 

D.9.6  Fuel Cell Oxygen Reactant Overview 

The fuel cell interacts with the oxygen supply in varying ways according to the nature of the fuel 
cell. For example, a H2-O2 system operating with gases supplied from stored reactants may 
interact minimally with the oxygen/ECS system as it does not consume oxygen from the air but 
may require air flow for cooling. However, a reformate-air fuel cell may consume oxygen from 
the cabin air supply for the fuel cell reaction, vent the products of the reaction to the cabin air 
and require cabin air for cooling. 

Table 9. Each Oxygen/Reactant Combination has Different Aircraft Design Implications identifies 
reactant/oxidizer combinations which are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

D.9.6.1  Stored Oxygen—Hydrogen 

This assumes pressurized O2 and H2. 

115 

 
•  Effect on fuel cell performance: From a fuel cell performance standpoint, this combination 

is optimal. The fuel cell reaction benefits from higher O2 PP and the PP of stored O2 
pressure can far exceed any possible with ambient or bleed air. 

•  Effect on O2 depletion: With oxygen supplied from storage there is no O2 depletion. 
However, care must be taken to consider failure modes that could cause high local 
concentrations of O2. 

•  Reaction by-products: In this case the only reaction by-products are heat and water in the 
form of liquid or vapor. Some hydrogen may also be vented but this can be much less than 
for air systems. As noted above the design should provide for proper venting of these by-
products. In the case of water vapor this may be a beneficial factor to air quality but 
consideration must be given to any design that introduces this water vapor to the cabin to 
ensure that there is no negative impact such as ensuring no local condensation that can 
lead to metal corrosion over time. 

•  Effect on Engine: Since the system is independent of the engine no effects are expected. 

•  Unique Bleed Air Effects on Cabin Interior Design: Factors such as heat rejection, O2 

depletion, water vapor and proper venting are common to all designs. 

•  Depressurization Considerations: Since the O2 supply is independent of cabin or bleed air 
the fuel cell reaction is not affected unless heat removal is via ambient air. Consideration 
should be given to of heat removal during a depressurization event. 

D.9.6.2  Stored Oxygen—Reformate 

This assumes oxygen is stored in a pressurized tank, but the fuel is supplied by a reformer. 

•  Effect on Fuel Cell Performance:  Generally, these comments are the same as for H2-O2. 

•  Effect on O2 depletion:  Same comments as for H2-O2 

•  Reaction by Products:  Same comments as for H2-O2 except additional by-products of the 

reformation reaction must be addressed 

•  Effect on Engine:  Same comments as for H2-O2 

•  Unique Bleed Air Effects on Cabin Interior Design:  Same as for H2-O2. 

•  Depressurization Considerations:  Same as for H2-O2 

D.9.6.3  Oxygen from Bleed Air—H2 Fuel from Storage Tank 

This assumes the oxygen is derived from bleed air and the fuel cell system uses pressurized H2 
gas as the reactant fuel. 

•  Effect on Fuel cell performance:  From a fuel cell performance standpoint, this combination 
is highly attractive. The fuel cell reaction benefits from higher O2 PP and with bleed air 
pressures as high as 40 psia O2 PP is approximately 8 psi. This combination does however 

116 

 
require interaction with the engine bleed system. The tradeoffs of this must be assessed by 
each aircraft designer. 

•  Effect on O2 depletion:  With oxygen supplied from bleed air no cabin oxygen is consumed 
so this approach has minimal general or local oxygen depletion due to the reaction however 
some amount of O2 depleted air would be vented. It is expected this amount of depletion 
would be inconsequential but any design should perform the analysis required to ensure 
safe and proper venting of the O2 depleted bleed air. 

•  Reaction by-products:  In this case the only reaction by-products are heat and water in the 
form of liquid or vapor and O2 depleted bleed air. Some hydrogen will also be vented with 
nitrogen diffusing from the air. As noted above the design should provide for proper venting 
of these by products. In the case of water vapor this may be a beneficial factor to air quality 
but consideration must be given to any design that introduces this water vapor to the cabin 
to ensure that there are no negative impacts such as ensuring no local condensation that 
can lead to metal corrosion over time. 

•  Effect on Engine:  While the majority of large transport aircraft utilize engine bleed air for 
ECS, modern aircraft design is trending away from this to improve fuel economy. The 
amount of air required for a fuel cell seems to be below levels that would impact engine 
performance or efficiency however the aircraft designers must decide, using their own 
criteria, if this type of oxygen supply is beneficial. 

•  Unique Bleed Air Effects on Cabin Interior Design:  Factors such as heat rejection, O2 

depletion, water vapor and proper venting are common to all designs however when engine 
bleed air is utilized consideration must be given to introduction of this to the fuel cell 
location including routing of lines and failure modes. 

•  Depressurization Considerations:  Use of engine bleed air is beneficial in a depressurization 

scenario. The fuel cell reaction, especially for a PEM fuel cell, is highly sensitive to the 
oxygen PP of the reaction. As long as the engines are operational, bleed air at design 
pressure will continue to flow to the fuel cell and fuel cell operation will not be adversely 
impacted by a depressurization due to reduction of O2 pressure. If the engines cease 
operation the fuel cell will also cease operation. In this scenario provision should be made 
for a separate O2 supply. 

D.9.6.4  Oxygen from Cabin Air—H2 Fuel from Storage Tank 

This assumes air is consumed from the cabin and the fuel is pressurized H2. 

•  Effect on Fuel cell performance:  From a fuel cell performance standpoint, this combination 
is less attractive than use of bleed air but is viable. The typical cabin pressure at altitude is 
10.9 psia resulting in a PP of approximately 2.2 psi vs. 8 psi when bleed air is utilized. 
However, cabin air is widely available providing a designer with freedom to site the fuel cell 
in many locations and blowers/compressors that elevate air pressure are commonly used in 
many fuel cell systems to increase O2 PP. The tradeoffs of this vs. bleed air must be 
assessed by each aircraft designer. 

117 

 
•  Effect on O2 depletion:  With oxygen supplied from cabin air the oxygen available for life 
support is reduced by the amount consumed by the fuel cell. The amount depends on the 
particular fuel cell but this needs to be considered in system design and location. A human 
consumes approximately 0.44 g/min of O2 while a fuel cell will consume approximately 9 g 
O2/min/kw. For a 200-passenger aircraft, a 10kW fuel cell would consume O2 at rate of 
approximately 90g O2/min while 200 passengers would consume O2 at a total rate of 200 x 
0.44g/min = 88 g/min total. So, for a 10kW fuel cell this would equate to approximately the 
O2 consumption of 200 passengers. Due to the design of the typical ECS under CFR part 25 
this would only reduce O2 PPs by a very small amount (by about an additional 0.8%) and 
this expected amount of depletion would be inconsequential but any design should perform 
the analysis required to confirm this. (from the publication cited above) 

The rate of flow of outside air has a substantial and direct impact on the concentration of 
contaminants in the cabin air. The flow rate has a negligible effect on the PO2, in that only a 
tiny portion of the oxygen in this air is consumed by the aircraft occupants. A typical 
sedentary adult consumes oxygen at about 0.44 g/min (0.001 lb/min) (Nishi 1981). With the 
CFR part 25 minimal design outside-air flow rate of 0.25 kg/min (0.55 lb/min) per cabin 
occupant, oxygen is brought into the cabin at 0.058 kg/min (0.127 lb/min) per person. 
Oxygen consumption by the occupants reduces the PO2 levels by about 0.8% in this case, 
compared with a PO2 reduction of up to 25% due to the reduced cabin pressure, as 
explained earlier. Thus, adequate oxygen concentrations in the cabin are maintained, even 
at ventilation rates far below those specified in CFR part 25, as long as the cabin is 
adequately pressurized. 

•  Reaction by products:  As with the H2-Bleed air case, in this case the only reaction by-
products are heat and water in the form of liquid or vapor and O2 depleted air. Some 
hydrogen will also be vented as nitrogen diffusing from the air impacts hydrogen-side fuel 
cell performance and must be vented. As noted above, the design should provide for proper 
venting of these by-products. In the case of water vapor this may be a beneficial factor to 
air quality but consideration must be given to any design that introduces this water vapor to 
the cabin to ensure that there are no negative impacts such as ensuring no local 
condensation that can lead to metal corrosion over time. 

•  Effect on Engine:  Since there is no direct interface with the engine there is no direct effect 

on the engine. 

•  Use of Cabin Air on Cabin Interior Design:  While the overall effects related to humidity, 

oxygen depletion, and heat generation appear to be reasonable, attention must be paid to 
proper design. For example, if an area containing a fuel cell were improperly ventilated 
there could be a risk of oxygen depletion to dangerous levels. 

•  Depressurization Considerations:  The fuel cell reaction, especially for a PEM fuel cell, is 

highly sensitive to the oxygen PP of the reaction. In a depressurization, cabin pressure may 
rapidly decrease from 10.9 psia (O2 PP of 2.1 psi) to about 0.4 psi impacting fuel cell 
performance. Fuel cell design must consider operation under these conditions. 

118 

 
D.9.6.5  Oxygen from Bleed Air—H2 Fuel from Reformate 

This assumes oxygen is derived from bleed air and the fuel is from a reformer. 

•  Effect on Fuel cell performance:  From a fuel cell performance standpoint, this combination 
is highly attractive. The fuel cell reaction benefits from higher O2 PP and the air supply can 
be at pressures as high as 40 psia resulting in a PP of approximately 8 psi. This combination 
does however require interaction with the engine bleed system. The tradeoffs of this must 
be assessed by each aircraft designer. 

•  Effect on O2 depletion:  With oxygen supplied from bleed air no cabin oxygen is consumed 
so this approach has minimal general or local oxygen depletion due to the reaction however 
some amount of O2 depleted air would be vented. It is expected this amount of depletion 
would be inconsequential but any design should perform the analysis required to ensure 
safe and proper venting of the O2 depleted bleed air. 

•  Reaction by products:  Comments from H2-O2 must be considered.  The designer must also 
consider management of reformate waste products including CO2 and possibly CO and 
added heat from reformation reaction. 

•  Effect on Engine: While most large transport aircraft utilize engine bleed air for ECS, 

modern aircraft design is trending away from this to improve fuel economy. The amount of 
air required for a fuel cell seems to be below levels that would impact engine performance 
or efficiency however the aircraft designers must decide, using their own criteria, if this type 
of oxygen supply is beneficial. 

•  Unique Bleed Air Effects on Cabin Interior Design:  Factors such as heat rejection, O2 

depletion, water vapor and proper venting are common to all designs however when engine 
bleed air is utilized consideration must be given to introduction of this to the fuel cell 
location including routing of lines and failure modes. 

•  Depressurization Considerations: Use of engine bleed air is beneficial in a depressurization 
scenario. The fuel cell reaction, especially for a PEM fuel cell, is highly sensitive to the 
oxygen PP of the reaction. As long as the engines are operational, bleed air at design 
pressure will continue to flow to the fuel cell and fuel cell operation will not be adversely 
impacted by a depressurization due to reduction of O2 pressure. If the engines cease 
operation the fuel cell will also cease operation. In this scenario provision should be made 
for a separate O2 supply. 

D.9.6.6  Oxygen from Cabin Air—H2 Fuel from Reformate 

This assumes air is consumed from the cabin and the fuel is from a reformer. 

•  Effect on Fuel cell performance:  From a fuel cell performance standpoint, this combination 
is less attractive than use of bleed air but is viable. The typical cabin pressure at altitude is 
10.9 psia resulting in a PP of approximately 2.2 psi vs. 8 psi when bleed air is utilized. 
However, cabin air is widely available providing a designer with freedom to site the fuel cell 

119 

 
in many locations. The tradeoffs of this vs. bleed air must be assessed by each aircraft 
designer. 

•  Effect on O2 depletion:  With oxygen supplied from cabin air the oxygen available for life 
support is reduced by the amount consumed by the fuel cell. The amount depends on the 
particular fuel cell but this needs to be considered in system design and location. A human 
consumes approximately 0.44 g/min of O2 while a fuel cell will consume approximately 9 g 
O2/min/kw. For a 200-passenger aircraft, a 10kW fuel cell would consume O2 at rate of 
approximately 90g O2/min while 200 passengers would consume O2 at a total rate of 200 x 
0.44g/min = 88 g/min total. So, for a 10kW fuel cell this would equate to approximately the 
O2 consumption of 200 passengers. Due to the design of the typical ECS under CFR part 25 
this would only reduce O2 PPs by a very small amount (by about an additional 0.8%) and 
this expected amount of depletion would be inconsequential but any design should perform 
the analysis required to confirm this (from the publication cited above). 

The rate of flow of outside air has a substantial and direct impact on the concentration of 
contaminants in the cabin air. The flow rate has a negligible effect on the PO2, in that only a 
tiny portion of the oxygen in this air is consumed by the aircraft occupants. A typical 
sedentary adult consumes oxygen at about 0.44 g/min (0.001 lb/min) (Nishi 1981). With the 
CFR part 25 minimal design outside-air flow rate of 0.25 kg/min (0.55 lb/min) per cabin 
occupant, oxygen is brought into the cabin at 0.058 kg/min (0.127 lb/min) per person. 
Oxygen consumption by the occupants reduces the PO2 levels by about 0.8% in this case, 
compared with a PO2 reduction of up to 25% due to the reduced cabin pressure, as 
explained earlier. Thus, adequate oxygen concentrations in the cabin are maintained, even 
at ventilation rates far below those specified in CFR part 25, as long as the cabin is 
adequately pressurized. 

•  Reaction by products:  Comments from H2-O2 must be considered.  The designer must also 
consider management of reformate waste products including CO2 and possibly CO and 
added heat from reformation reaction. 

•  Effect on Engine:  Since there is no direct interface with the engine there is no direct effect 

on the engine. 

•  Effects on Cabin Interior Design:  While the overall effects related to humidity, oxygen 

depletion, and heat generation appear to be reasonable, attention must be paid to proper 
design. For example, if an area containing a fuel cell were improperly ventilated there could 
be a risk of oxygen depletion to dangerous levels. 

•  Depressurization Considerations:  The fuel cell reaction, especially for a PEM fuel cell, is 

highly sensitive to the oxygen PP of the reaction. In a depressurization, cabin pressure may 
rapidly decrease from 10.9 psia (O2 PP of 2.1 psi) to about 0.4 psi impacting fuel cell 
performance. Fuel cell design must consider operation under these conditions.

  REGENERATIVE FUEL CELL ENERGY STORAGE 

Regenerative fuel cell energy storage (RFCES) systems encompass systems where there is 
electrochemical cell technology providing electrical power by operating in fuel cell mode and 
also electrochemical cell technology providing reactant generation by operating in electrolysis 
mode. In the electrolysis operation mode, incoming water is electrochemically separated into 
its hydrogen and oxygen components by the reverse chemical reaction of the fuel cell. Specific 
cell operating characteristics determine if the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. The 
overall electrolysis reaction for a water reactant is: 

Electrolysis Reaction: H2O + Electricity  H2 + ½ O2 

The fuel cell and electrolyzer functions can be split into discrete functions, where one or more 
set of stacks operate in fuel cell (FC) mode and then one or more different stacks operate in 
electrolysis (EL) mode (see Figure 43), or as a unitized function where the same stack operates 
in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes (see Figure 44). 

Figure 43. Discrete Stacks in a Simplified Regenerative FC Energy Storage (RFCES) System 

[Operation shown in fuel cell mode (left) and electrolysis mode (right) for discrete stacks] 

121 

 
 
Figure 44. Unitized Stacks Operating in a Simplified RFCES System 

[Operation shown in fuel cell mode (left) and electrolysis mode (right)] 

An RFCES system can operate as a fuel cell using hydrogen and oxygen reactants to generate 
power and water when external power is not available. When external power is supplied, the 
system it can use the external power to electrochemically convert the stored water back to 
hydrogen and oxygen gas. The electrolyzer stack may supply the gas pressurization for storage 
or a separate compressor may supply the pressurization. RFCES systems primarily operate as a 
closed system with the water generated being used to supply all reactants needed. An example 
application for an airborne RFCES system would be in an unmanned aerial vehicle operating 
over a day/night cycle, where electrical power is supplied by solar cells during the day to 
provide vehicle power and also support electrolysis operation to generate reactants. Then in 
the evening when solar power is not available, the system would produce power from the 
stored reactants.  A RFCES system would also have an advantage if there is power available that 
would normally be wasted which could instead be used in the RFCES to increase to total 
efficiency of the system. 

Depending on the type of fuel cell, multiple reactants may be used to power non-regenerative, 
or open-loop, fuel cells when the fuel cell is being used only for power production. However, 
when used for regenerative energy storage, the fuel cell has to operate using hydrogen and 
oxygen gas that can be generated from water electrolysis. Primarily PEMFC and SOFC cell 
technology has been investigated for RFCES systems, with more demonstrator systems using 
PEMFC technology as it is considered to be at a higher readiness level than SOFC. 
Demonstrators for PEMFC regenerative systems have used both unitized and discrete stacks. 
Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells have a shift in their voltage performance when the same 
stack operates between fuel cell and electrolysis modes, as shown in Figure 45. Because of this, 
many PEMFC regenerative system demonstrators have focused on using discrete stacks where 
each stack can be tailored for either fuel cell or electrolysis operation, allowing for a more 
efficient total system than would be possible in a unitized stack. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell 
technology operates at a significantly higher temperature than PEMFC, and has a more linear 
voltage relationship when operated across fuel cell and electrolysis modes as shown in 

122 

 
 
Figure 45 but has had more limited development for use in regenerative systems. It should be 
noted that the data shown in Figure 45 is shown as an example for curve characteristics only 
and is not meant to portray representative performance across all cells. Performance of cells in 
a stack will vary based on operating conditions, manufacturer, and stack technology. 

Figure 45. Example Cell Voltage Characteristics Between Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Operation 

RFCES systems have many of the same fuel cell performance characteristics as 
non-regenerative or open loop fuel cells. However, since any fluid that is exhausted or vented 
from the system can result in less fuel available for use later on, regenerative fuel cell systems 
are typically operated as a closed loop system. Thus, fluid handling in RFCES systems is more 
critical. Typically, reactants loaded into regenerative systems initially are of higher purity, and 
additional hardware is included in the system in order to maintain reactant purity. This limits 
the need to purge (i.e. remove inerts) and helps protect the cells from degradation.  Due to the 
fact that RFCES systems are usually operating on pure, pressurized reactants, the efficiencies of 
the fuel cell mode operation in RFCES are generally higher than lower pressure air-based fuel 
cell systems.  The total roundtrip efficiency of a RFCES system can have a wide range, 
dependent on specific designs (type of cell, unitized or discrete stacks) and operation (power 
levels, pressures, duration, etc.).  Various efficiencies for RFCES systems have been published.  
Initial discrete PEM stack based breadboard systems have shown roundtrip efficiencies of over 
42%10, and studies have cited roundtrip efficiencies as high as greater than 80%11 for discrete 
stacks in ground based, high temperature RFCES systems. It is desirable in both unitized and

discrete regenerative fuel cell systems to limit the amount of reactant crossover in the stack as 
internal leakage in a RFCES system has a direct negative impact on efficiency.  While RFCES 
systems generally have lower roundtrip efficiencies than battery based systems, RFCES systems 
have the advantage of being able to size the reactant storage portion of the system 
independently from the power and reactant generation portion of the system. 

As in non-regenerative systems, RFCES balance of plant components are needed to ensure that 
fluids are supplied and removed from the electrochemical stacks at the correct pressures, flow 
ranges, humidity, and temperature. In many cases, RFCES systems require more complexity in 
the balance of plant components as fluids are processed rather than exhausted out of the 
system. For example, electrolysis operation necessitates more extensive water handling 
components than in a fuel cell only operation, such as water pumps to supply flow to the cell 
stack. Electrolysis products of hydrogen and oxygen destined for gas storage in tanks must be 
dried or water extraction components added to the tanks to limit condensed water build up in 
the gas tanks. Gas processing and storage components need to maintain separation of 
hydrogen and oxygen gas to preclude unintended gas mixtures from forming. Heat exchangers 
or heaters are needed for most incoming reactants to the stacks. As most RFCES systems are 
closed loop, most waste heat from the systems need to be rejected via heat exchangers rather 
than directly through exhaust.  Solid oxide technology operating as an electrolyzer requires 
higher temperature heat exchangers and a means of generating steam to feed the electrolysis 
operation. 

Regenerative fuel cell systems usually require additional power management from an external 
source (i.e. from solar cells, excess engine power) to support electrolysis operation with 
appropriate currents/voltages. Discrete stack RFCES have the advantage of being able to tailor 
the fuel cell and electrolysis stack design to support different power and voltage ranges for 
each operational mode. Unitized stacks have the same group of cells functioning in both fuel 
cell and electrolysis modes, and therefore are limited to the operational voltages dictated by 
the stack’s IV curve. Because of this, unitized stacks normally operate at a higher voltage in 
electrolysis mode than in fuel cell mode which can lead to a more complex electrical power 
system design. 

Multiple non-regenerative fuel cell demonstrators have flown on aircraft, but limited testing or 
demonstrations have been performed on RFCES systems for aircraft. A PEM RFCES system was 
built and tested at NASA Glenn Research Center in 2005. The system operated for 5 days on 
day/night cycles. An OEM in collaboration with its partners, flew a regenerative fuel cell 
demonstrator in 2012 (see Figure 46).

 APPLICATIONS FOR FUEL CELL SYSTEMS 

  OVERVIEW 

This appendix discusses several potential applications for fuel cells.  These are illustrated in 
Figure 47 through Figure 50.  The applications described are only examples and do not provide 
the details necessary to be considered complete enough for an actual certification program.  
The appendix also discusses FCS integration with other airplane systems (section E.2.) 

One potential application is a using a solid oxide fuel cell as an auxiliary power unit (APU).  
Auxiliary power units are typically located in the tapered tail cone section of the rear fuselage in 
commercial jet aircraft, as shown in Figure 48.  The current technology is shown along with an 
insert of an SOFC system that has been developed to an early prototype level for the trucking 
industry.  In that application, the fuel cell uses truck fuel to provide overnight cab power 
instead of running the diesel engine.  The APU application is discussed in section E.4. 

The use of fuel cells could also be used in galley carts, as shown in Figure 49.  Emergency 
power, as well as distributed power, and energy storage, applications areas shown in Figure 50, 
where fuel cell systems can be integrated and operated throughout the aircraft. 

Sections E.3 through E.7 discuss various applications for fuel cells in aviation.

  FUEL CELL INTEGRATION WITH AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS 

Installing a fuel cell system on an aircraft involve some level of integration with other aircraft 
systems.  On one end of the spectrum of applications, a FCS may, for example, generate a small 
amount of supplemental electrical power to a dedicated payload onboard the aircraft that is 
independent of the aircraft electrical power sources. Thus, requiring only minor modifications 
to the aircraft in order to accommodate the FCS.  On the other end of the spectrum, a FCS may 
be used to provide primary electrical power, supply water, or supply inerting gas to the aircraft.  
This would require it to operate in tight connection with other aircraft systems, thus, imposing 
major modifications to the aircraft.  The lower levels of integration may be the easiest point of 
entry, requiring less modification to the aircraft design or operation and fewer safety 
implications. 

The intent here is not to describe all the possible applications that a FCS may address onboard 
an aircraft. Rather, the purpose of this section is to describe and classify them in such a way 
that any application may be filled by potentially a range of fuel cell system technologies.  The 
applications are described as they appear from the aircraft view point and the type of functions 
that they are required to provide. Including the expected benefits that they bring to the aircraft 
and how they integrate into the platform.  Therefore, the key metrics differentiating the 
applications must be defined from the point of view of the aircraft, and not in terms of 
technology variants. 

The applications of a FCS onboard an aircraft may therefore be differentiated according to the 
following characteristics: 

•  The intended functions to be provided by the FCS, in particular the role it plays in ensuring 
aircraft safety and systems’ reliability.  This can be captured under the existing criticality 
classifications. 

•  The level of integration of the FCS within the aircraft platform 

These two characteristics should yield an assessment of the complexity of the installation, 
integration, operation, and maintenance of FCS for a given application. 

The criticality for passenger aircraft can be broken down into the following three categories: 

(1) NON-ESSENTIAL—Functions whose failures would not contribute to or cause a failure 
condition which would significantly impact the safety of the airplane or the ability of the 
flight crew to cope with adverse operating conditions. Airplane conditions which result 
from improper accomplishment or loss of non-essential functions may be probable. 

(2) ESSENTIAL—Functions whose failures would contribute to or cause a failure 
condition which would significantly impact the safety of the airplane or the ability of the 
flight crew to cope with adverse operating conditions. Failure conditions which result 
from improper accomplishment or loss of essential functions must be improbable. 

(3) CRITICAL—Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition 
which would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Failure 

130 

 
conditions which result from improper accomplishment or loss of critical functions must 
be extremely improbable. 

The level of criticality will have an impact on the introduction of new technology into a specific 
application.  The criticality can also depend on the concept of operation.  This report will 
provide one or two concepts of operation, but does not cover all the ways to design the power 
system and aircraft, and the possible operational scenarios. 

The level of integration is related to the number and complexity of the interfaces between the 
fuel cell system defined in the main body of the report section 2.1 and the aircraft hardware, 
processes and operations as defined in Figure 51.  These interface types help structure and 
classify the interfaces and provide a measure of the level of integration. The highly integrative 
nature of fuel cell technologies will require review of multiple regulatory areas.

There are a number of applications addressed in this section. Table 9 provides typical examples 
of key parameters for these applications. There are two applications in the table (and 
applications not even included in the table) that are not covered in the detailed sections to 
follow, but those that are included provide examples of the strategies and approaches for 
integrating fuel cells into an aircraft.  The fuel cell type and fuels identified in the table and the 
sections below are one possible approach.  These examples were picked because they have the 
best definition of the systems and the interfaces at this time.

E.2.1  General Description of Typical Aircraft Galley 

A transport category airplane typically has several galleys installed at various positions in the 
aircraft Figure 52 shows an installation example). 

134 

 
Figure 52. Schematic of Typical Cabin Layout Illustrating Galley Installation at 
Various Locations in the A/C 

A galley includes several types of galley inserts that are divided in two main categories: non-
electrical inserts and electrical inserts (GAINS) that are used to store and prepare beverages 
and food for passengers. Typical galley requirements are shown in Table 10.

A galley unit is typically composed of: 

•  A galley structure/monument (housing the various galley inserts) 

•  A set of Electrical Galley Inserts (GAINs) for 

o  Beverage makers 
o  Coffee makers 
o  Ovens (steam oven, convection oven) 
o  Water Boiler 
o  Bun Warmer / Toaster 

•  A set of non-electrical inserts (Standards Units, Trolleys) mostly used for stowage purpose. 

135 

 
 
 
•  Work lights required / necessary in the galley monument vicinity. 

Optionally, galleys can also include air chillers (used to maintain food cold before it is served to 
passengers) and trash compactors.  The exact definition of the Galley equipment list is defined 
by each customer depending on the targeted route and service level. 

The main galley / aircraft interfaces are as follows: 

•  Mechanical interfaces (interfaces between the galley structure/monument and the aircraft) 

•  Water system interfaces (interfaces between galley and both potable and waste water 

aircraft systems) 

•  Air / ventilation system interfaces (interfaces between galley and fresh air supply and 

interfaces between “used air” (from the ovens and air chiller units) from the galley and the 
cabin air extraction system) 

•  Electrical power supply 

o  Electric power is supplied as 115 VAC 400Hz 3 phases to the GAINS and 28 VDC to 
work lights (generally generated from the 115 VAC supply through Transformer 
Rectifier Unit installed in the galley). 

o  Electric power is supplied to the galleys through dedicated power feeders. Each 

galley position in the aircraft is allocated and number of power feeders. 

•  Human-Machine Interface (to power on/off and to report about the system status) 

E.2.2  Functional Description/Operation 

In this fuel cell powered galley concept, a fuel cell system is provided that is dedicated to 
generating and providing power and energy to galley loads such as: 

•  Galley inserts (e.g., ovens, water boilers, beverage makers, bun warmers) 

•  Air chillers, 

•  Trash compactors, 

•  Lights 

The general capabilities of the fuel cell system are shown in Table 11.  The FCS is specifically 
designed to power the dedicated set of galley loads and the complete FCS is not connected to 
the aircraft electrical power network. It is therefore operated completely autonomously and 
remotely with regards to this aircraft electrical power network.

As further options (then impacting the system design and rated power), the system might also: 

1.  Provide electric power/energy to other equipment located remotely from the galley 

position, 

2.  Be connected to the aircraft electrical power network so as to complement or backup 

“conventional” power supply to some equipment. 

Moreover, FCS by-products (water, heat and Oxygen Depleted Air) might be used to fulfill or 
contribute to some of the required galley functions: 

•  Use heat generated by the FCS to provide heat to some of the heat consumers (e.g., galley 

inserts, beverage makers, water boilers). 

•  Use water generated by the FCS either as potable water or for non-potable water needs 

(toilet for instance). 

•  Use Oxygen Depleted Air generated by FCS for fuel tank inerting. 

E.2.3  Architecture Principles 

A schematic of a fuel cell powered galley is presented in Figure 53.  It illustrates the system 
architecture and main interfaces between the system and the aircraft cabin.  These interfaces 
are described in more detail below. 

137 

 
 
Figure 53. Fuel cell galley functional architecture (example) 

For a fuel cell powered galley, oxygen is drawn from the cabin air and supplied to the fuel cell 
stack after appropriate conditioning (pressure, temperature and humidity).  Hydrogen can be 
supplied either from a high pressure compressed gas source (typically 350 bars H2 gas vessels) 
or from alternatives storage means described in 0. Before being supplied to the fuel cell, 
hydrogen is also conditioned (pressure, temperature and humidity) so that the fuel cell is 
operated in the most favorable conditions. 

Fuel cell generates electric power under certain voltage characteristics. This needs to be 
controlled and adapted to the galleys consumer’s electrical characteristics requirements 
(28 VDC, 115 VAC or DC high voltage). This is achieved through dedicated power conversion and 
control equipment. In order to fulfill the requested mission profile and to optimize the system 
sizing and weight, the fuel cell is associated with a secondary energy supply device (i.e., a 
battery) that allows for an optimal hybridization strategy. 

Furthermore, to provide a completely autonomous solution, the secondary energy device is 
sized such as it can supply the required energy to ensure startups and shutdowns of the system. 
This is because the FCS cannot start by itself as it needs pre-start safety checks (such as 
hydrogen detection) and need also power to bring oxidant to the stack. 

Heat generated by the fuel cell is collected by a liquid heat carrier and then further transferred 
to a dedicated radiator equipped with a fan. The heat not used within the system is then 

138 

 
 
released in the cabin air. Before being transferred to the radiator, this heat carrier is also 
circulated to equipment in the system requiring significant cooling capacity (power conversion 
and compressor for instance). 

The heat generated by the fuel cell system is used in the galley to replace some of the electrical 
consumers. This has multiple advantages: it reduces the electrical requirements (thereby 
reducing the amount of hydrogen required for the mission) and it also reduces the amount of 
heat to be released to the cabin air. 

Water generated by the fuel cell is used within the system to fulfill the fuel cell reactant gas 
humidification requirements. Remaining water is then expelled out of the system to the aircraft 
water and waste system. 

Installation of the system can be performed in either in one single location, or in a modular 
approach, with modules installed in different locations.

According to the above-mentioned description and architecture principles, aircraft interfaces

* The standards are only based on the general descriptions of the applications. In an actual certification 
program, the Aviation Authority will decide which standards are applicable. A detailed examination of 
applicable regulatory standards for FCS in general is discussed in Appendix G. 

•  Mechanical (fixing features of the galley to the aircraft – mostly should not be impacted by 

the addition of fuel cell system)) 

•  NEW - No more electrical interfaces to the aircraft electrical power network 

•  NEW - Air supply to the fuel cell system (added) and to the Galley inserts (as for 

conventional system). Air is taken from the cabin, and therefore there is an indirect link to 
the Environmental Control System (ECS). 

•  NEW - Oxygen Depleted Air Exhaust (ODA). Fuel cell operation consumes part of the oxygen 
fed to the fuel cell. The exhaust gas from the cathode side of the fuel cell has therefore a 
low level of oxygen (compared to air). Two options can then be considered for expelling this 
ODA gas out of the system. 

o  Exhaust ODA directly in the cabin environment. In this configuration, this creates a 
new interface with cabin air (and therefore ECS) and cabin equipment (ODA gas 
composition and flowrate will have to be taken into consideration to assess this 
impact) 

140 

 
 
o  Exhaust ODA outside cabin or aircraft. In this configuration, this creates new 
mechanical interfaces with the aircraft as the ODA has to be ducted to the 
appropriate disposal location. 

•  NEW - Heat generated by the fuel is collected through a dedicated coolant loop. For each 
kW of electricity generated, about 1 kW of heat is also generated. Part of this heat is used 
for ensuring galley functions, but the remaining heat is disposed of to the cabin air. This 
creates an additional new interface between the galley and the aircraft cabin (and the ECS). 

•  Water and Waste System interfaces. 

o  Potable Water inlet to the galley or use in water boilers, beverages makers and/or 

ovens. 

o  Waste water exhausts 

  From Galley inserts. These are required for expelling “used” water out of the 

galley. 

  NEW From fuel Cell system. Water generated by the fuel cell can be used in the 
galley environment, but most probably some water will not be used and needs 
to be expelled out of the galley. This waste water from the fuel cell system could 
also be mixed with the waste water from the galley to save unnecessary 
interfaces. 

•  NEW – Hydrogen Supply and vent lines. These interfaces are specifically required because of 
the presence of the fuel cell system in the galley environment. Several interfaces may have 
to be considered depending on the system configuration and installation. 

o  Hydrogen supply: 

  Case 1: hydrogen storage system is “self-contained” and located in a galley 

cart/trolley. This configuration does not create any additional interfaces with the 
aircraft (interfaces between the storage and the fuel cell system are provided 
inside the galley). 

  Case 2: hydrogen storage system is installed in a remote location from the galley 
position. In this configuration, additional new interfaces (hydrogen containing 
piping) are created between the galley and the hydrogen storage location. 

  For both cases, abnormal operation or failure from the system itself, but also 
from other equipment in the system surrounding has to be taken into account 
(need for venting out hydrogen contained in the storage in case of fire for 
instance). 

  Case 1 has many advantages and is for now preferred. 

Hydrogen refilling is done during normal trolley refurbishing. It should not 
increase the maintenance duration of AC between 2 flights. 
The trolley is refilled outside the aircraft which is safer. 
Hydrogen trolley is installed in the galley and fixed by a dedicated tooling. The 
trolley can only be removed and installed by trained operator with a special tool 

141 

 
to avoid wrong trolley manipulation. 
The hydrogen is delivered through a quick connector at the rear of the trolley. 
Leak tightness is ensured by automatic test. 

  Hydrogen functional normal hydrogen releases. During normal operation, the 

fuel cell system may release hydrogen (due to permeation through the fuel cell 
stack sealing or to functional purges for instance). These “normal” hydrogen 
release will then be released into the galley surroundings directly to the cabin air 
(after adequate dilution and/or mitigation) or vented outside the aircraft. This 
creates interface with the ECS which has to be taken into consideration. 

  Hydrogen leakage management. In case of abnormal operation or failure, 

abnormal hydrogen release from the system could occur. As for “functional” 
hydrogen releases during normal operation, abnormal releases would be 
released in the galley surroundings after appropriate dilution and/or mitigation. 
This creates interface with the ECS which has to be taken into consideration. 

•  Human- Machine Interface. The fuel cell powered galley will be completely autonomous 
from aircraft electrical network, but will still have to allow crew members to power it on 
and off, to report about its status to the crew. An enable button is also foreseen in the flight 
deck, allowing pilots to authorize the fuel cell startup but also switch off the system. 

This application is non-essential and has only a few interfaces (level of integration) to the 
aircraft.

  APPLICATION:  STAND ALONE POWER 

This type of system is self-contained and can be installed and removed from the aircraft.  
Examples of such applications include the powering of payload in “special aircraft”.  A “special 
aircraft” is defined as an aircraft which has been modified to accommodate specific missions, 
which are not passenger or cargo transport, such as: 

•  Medical evacuation (“Medevac”) 

•  Electronic warfare 

•  Maritime surveillance 

The associated payload may therefore be: 

•  Medical kits including beds and monitoring devices, freezers, heaters 

•  Weapon guidance systems, 

•  Radars, observation devices, 

A dedicated FCS may be used to supply the power to such payload, independently from the 
native aircraft’s electrical network. 

The following sections detail the case of a Medevac application on a business jet, as illustrated 
in Figure 55 and Figure 56. 

Figure 55. Dedicated Medevac Aircraft 

143 

 
 
Figure 56. Dedicated Medevac Aircraft—On-Board Installation 

E.3.1  General Description of Medevac on Special Aircraft 

Getting an airline aircraft modified to accommodate someone with a straight leg means 
removing seats, increasing the time it takes to board, and having specific personnel to 
accompany, so it can be expensive and cumbersome to organize. 

Moreover, airliners operate from main airports, so liaison to them is a concern, while business 
jets can operate from smaller airports, meaning a faster and easier access. Business aircraft fly 
higher than commercial airliners, thus are less subject to air turbulences and this can be critical 
for injured passengers. For all these reasons, Medevac missions are best accommodated with 
business jets.  A medevac medical module is shown in Figure 57. 

Power generation capability for medical equipment and redundancy in case of failure is key to 
the success of the Medevac mission. The Medevac payload typically consists of: 

•  A medical module which carries a stretcher, with dedicated lighting, oxygen bottles, several 

pieces of monitoring and analysis equipment, etc. 

•  A blood bank with power supply for conditioning, storage of medical equipment (blood gas 

analyzer, etc.) 

•  A loading system (lift device). 

144 

 
 
Figure 57. Medevac Medical Module 

Today the power required to operate the medical equipment is supplied by the native aircraft 
generators. A malfunction of the aircraft electrical generation or distribution system could 
jeopardize the medical mission. There have been instances when lives were lost in this kind of 
situation. 

E.3.2  Fuel Cell Powered Medevac Payload on a Special Aircraft 

The application described here consists in using a dedicated FCS to supply electrical power to 
Medevac modules on-board a Special Aircraft. 

It is expected that the use of a dedicated FCS will improve the reliability of vital power supply to 
the Medevac modules. 

Such a system would consist of a fuel cell (a stack and its ancillaries), a H2 storage sub-system 
and possibly an O2 storage sub-system. 

As most of the Medevac aircraft operators also use their aircraft for more conventional 
missions (passenger transport), it is important that the aircraft be easily rearranged from one 
configuration to another. 

The FCS would then be a plug and play box which should be easily mounted and dismounted 
into and from the aircraft. On a business jet the most convenient option is probably to install 
such a box in the luggage compartment, in the rear section of the cabin. 

145 

 
 
The amount of power required for the medical kits ranges from 3 to 5 kW and should be fairly 
constant throughout the flight. The operating time may reach 10 hours for certain missions. The 
energy needs to accomplish the mission may therefore be in the order of 40 kWh. 

The H2 storage sub-system and the rest of the FCS should therefore be sized against this 
requirement. 

The FCS will be sized in such a way that the heat generated by its operation remains within the 
limits of what the ECS is capable of handling in the cabin. Due to the location of the FCS in the 
rear of the pressurized area (luggage compartment) and because cabin air flows from front to 
rear, the temperature rise due to this additional heat rejection in the cabin will be spatially 
limited to the FCS vicinity.  However, the cabin temperature in a Medevac aircraft is usually set 
at higher levels than common aircraft, for the sake of the patient’s comfort. 

E.3.2.1  Functional Description 

Several different architectures may be laid out to address the needs of such an application. 
Below is a list of the main features that characterize these candidate architectures. It describes 
how these features can rely on different technical options (reference Figure 54).  An interface 
summary, Table 13, is found at the end of the section. 

• 

In order to manage transient loads, hybridization with a battery could be used. The fuel cell 
would then be responsible for recharging this battery on a regular basis throughout the 
course of the flight. 

•  The electrical power generated by the fuel cell would be supplied to the equipment via a 
dedicated bus, independent from the native aircraft network. For an application on a 
business jet, a 28 VDC bus could be used. 

•  The cooling of the FCS would be performed using heat exchange with the cabin 

environment via a dedicated radiator. 

•  The heat rejected by the FCS could also be used to heat up the medical beds, thus replacing 
the electrical heaters used in today’s equipment. A dedicated liquid loop would be used for 
this purpose. This principle would yield a smaller electrical demand from the equipment and 
thus a smaller, more optimized, FCS. 

•  The hydrogen would be stored in pressurized gas form in a dedicated tank. 

•  The oxidant required to accommodate the electrochemical reaction within the fuel cell may 
either come from cabin air or from a dedicated oxygen storage sub-system. On certain 
business jets, it may be preferable not to consume cabin air and instead obtain the O2 using 
compressed O2 in a dedicated tank. This source of compressed oxygen may very well be of 
the same kind as the one used in the medical equipment, and for which certification 
specifications already exist. 

•  Whether the oxidant source is compressed oxygen or cabin air, unconsumed oxygen 

(compressed O2 source) or Oxygen Depleted Air (cabin air as the O2 source) coming from 

146 

 
the FCS could then be released into the cabin atmosphere.  Although it is expected that the 
amount of additional O2 or ODA is negligible, it will be necessary to verify that this flow 
does not alter the composition of the overall cabin air to a point where it may impact the 
passengers or crew well-being. 

•  The water by-product could be collected and used for various purposes on-board. 

•  The FCS will be started and shut down according to a well-defined protocol which allows for 
a safe operation in any condition.  This protocol will include the purge phases which may be 
required for proper stack operation. The purge gas injected into the cabin should be 
handled in such a way that it does not introduce any safety concern.  There must be 
appropriate venting inside or to the outside for acceptable air-hydrogen mixture inside or 
outside the cabin. 

•  Similarly, any traces of H2 coming from permeation through stack seals or else must be 
handled in such a way that it does not introduce safety concern (i.e., an acceptable 
air-hydrogen mixture is maintained inside the cabin). H2 detectors may also be needed. 

•  Apart from the controlled hydrogen and O2 or ODA, no other gas release into the cabin is 

expected from the FCS. 

• 

It should be noted that H2 venting lines from the system may be needed to purge excess H2 
(Low, Medium or High Pressure) outside of the aircraft to prevent any undesired 
accumulation inside the cabin. These lines will need accommodation to outside of the 
aircraft.  Because of the very nature of the Medevac missions, the aircraft is not susceptible 
to remain on ground in harsh weather conditions for too long: The Medevac aircraft lands 
on an airfield to pick up the patients and departs back as fast as possible. In addition, the 
cabin atmosphere has to remain within the appropriate temperature condition, which 
implies that the FCS will most likely never have to endure freezing or even a cold start 
scenario. 

There are several important recommendations for designing a system for this application 

•  Safe H2-Air mixture management via use of dedicated enclosures and H2 monitoring 

•  Mounting and installation of system on-board to take into account presence of H2 venting 

line 

•  Mounting and installation of system on-board to take into account concept of 

replaceable/swappable H2 tanks

E.3.2.2  Safety 

The FCS must be monitored and controlled real-time with a dedicated set of sensors, 
monitoring and control units. 

These controllers should be designed to render this system independent from any operator’s 
intervention. The FCS will then be able to control itself autonomously and shut itself off in any 
abnormal conditions encountered. 

In addition to this, the flight crew will have access to key data regarding the FCS state of health 
during operation (e.g., battery status, hydrogen content, temperature) and will be in a position 
to shut it off if needed, via a dedicated interface (emergency button). 

The H2 storage sub-system should be equipped with dedicated sensors to allow for a real-time 
measurement of the hydrogen content in the vicinity air. 

In order to avoid any accumulation of hydrogen resulting from leaks, the H2 storage sub-system 
(vessel, distribution components, sensors, etc.) should be installed in a dedicated closed 
compartment which will be continuously ventilated. The composition of the air-hydrogen 
mixture exiting this compartment will be monitored so that the appropriate control actions may 
be triggered. 

Excess hydrogen susceptible to yield too rich of a hydrogen-air mixture in the cabin will be 
purged outside of the aircraft, via dedicated venting lines (low, medium, or high Pressure). 

148 

 
 
 
An additional fire extinguisher may be used by the flight or medical crew in the luggage 
compartment to handle an aircraft fire scenario in the vicinity of the FCS. 

As such, a FCS performs functions whose failures would not lead to safety concerns for the 
airplane or would impair the ability of the flight crew, it may be considered as a non-essential 
system. 

Yet, the failure of this system may very well have a critical impact on the well-being, even the 
life, of the patients being transported and taken care of. As such, a FCS should be considered at 
the same level of criticality for the patients as are the medical equipment themselves.

  APPLICATION:  AUXILIARY POWER 

An APU is defined by TSO-C77b as “Any gas turbine-powered unit delivering rotating shaft 
power or compressor air, or both, that is not intended for direct propulsion of an aircraft.” 

The APU main functions are: 

•  Provide bleed air or electrical power for main engine start (MES) 

•  Provide bleed air for the ECS when the main engines are off 

•  Provide electric power for the airplane when the main engines are off 

•  Provide hydraulic power for ground operations 

APUs vary based on the size and power architecture of the aircraft. A 90 KVA APU is shown in 
Figure 59. The electrical power requirement for an APU varies from about 40KW for a small 
regional airplane to 90kW for narrow body transport category airplane to 240kW for large wide 
body airplane to 450KW for large More Electric Aircraft (MEA).  Note that the traditional APU 
also provides pneumatic (bleed air) power for the ECS and MES whereas the MEA only demands 
electric power.  The bleed air system of the APU demand much more shaft power than that of 
the electric generator on the same APU. The combined power can reach 1.35 MW. 

150 

 
Figure 59. Narrow Body Transport Aircraft APU, 90 KVA 361 lbs (164KG) 

The performance and reliability criteria for any aircraft system are determined by the use of 
that system to maintain controls of the aircraft during normal and abnormal conditions. The 
criticality of an APU relative to flight safety in any particular aircraft installation will determine if 
the APU system should be considered essential, or non-essential.  Airplanes that rely on APUs 
for provision of back-up electrical power in flight in the event of a failure of the primary power 
sources are usually considered essential installations. 

Although it is unlikely that a fuel cell APU (FCAPU) would replace a traditional APU in form, fit, 
and function due to the size, weight, and other technical challenges; it is assumed as such for 
the purposes of discussion in this report.  This notional FCAPU application is described below.  
The general architecture is shown in Figure 60. 

151 

 
 
Figure 60. Notional Fuel Cell APU Functional Architecture 

The integration and installation aspects of the FCAPU includes at least the following: 

1.  The main FCAPU is housed in the FCAPU compartment of the aircraft, which is an 
unpressurized zone with a firewall separating it from the pressurized cabin. 

2.  The FCAPU includes the fuel processing system, fuel cell stack, fuel cell monitor and 
control, exhaust stream conditioning, and integrated power/thermal management 
system which may include turbo-machinery such as gas compressor and turbine, and 
burner/combustor. 

3.  There are physical penetrations in the FCAPU compartment which include the fuel 
interface, oxidant (air) interface, heat sink (cooling air) interface, electric power 
input/output interface, signal and control interface, exhaust stream interface, 
maintenance access panel, installation access panel. 

4.  There are external monitoring sensors inside the compartment for gas concentration, 
temperature, fire.  There is external fire suppression system inside the compartment. 

5.  The FCAPU is support by the compartment structure through mounting brackets and 
struts, which serves the functions of linear and rotational acceleration stability, shock 
absorption, vibration isolation. 

6.  The fuel is common jet fuel, stored in aircraft fuel tank.  It is supplied to the fuel 

processing equipment that includes desulfurizer and reformer before delivered to the 
fuel cell stack as hydrogen enriched fuel.  The major constituents of the hydrogen 
enriched fuel are CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and H2 during normal operation.  Alternatively, the 
fuel can be of ultra-low sulfur or bio-fuel stored in a dedicated fuel tank which can also 

152 

 
 
be used by the main engine as a reserve fuel blend.  In this case, the desulfurizer will not 
be necessary. 

7.  FCAPU uses air as oxidant, from cabin or from ambient free stream air, conditioned to 
the proper purity, pressure, and temperature before entering the fuel cell stack.  The 
operating pressure of the fuel and oxidant are between 1 to 3 bars. 

8.  The FCAPU is highly thermally integrated, and requires ambient air as heat sink to 

maintain operational conditions.  The spent waste ODA stream can be reused as icing 
protection before discharged overboard. 

9.  The fuel cell stack generates 270 VDC electric power that will be delivered to power 

conditioning equipment where it will be inverted and conditioned to 28VDC, 115VAC 
and 230 VAC @ 400Hz circuits before connected to the primary and secondary 
distribution systems. 

10. To ensure continuous airworthiness of the FCAPU, Build-In-Test (BIT) is constantly 

performed and monitored; periodical inspections and maintenance are required, such 
as a sulfur trap (if any), fuel, and air filters replacement, liquid replacement, and 
cleaning of equipment. 

11.

 The FCAPU is likely to run continuously for as long as practical to reduce thermal cycle. 
Also, the highly thermally integrated system responds slowly to varying load demand.  
To maintain optimal efficiency and power density, the FCAPU is designed to operate in 
either full load or standby condition.  Other energy supply devices such as regenerative 
fuel cells or batteries should be included in the overall aircraft power system 
architecture to manage the transient power demand.  However, these ESDs are not 
considered part of the FCAPU.

E.4.1  APU Aircraft Interfaces 

The interface types are described the Table 14.  This system is highly integrated (level of 
integration) and will require extensive design and development.  Given this high level of 
integration, when implemented, this system will be “Essential” or even “Critical”, and unlikely 
to be operated on the ground only.

The current APU requirements make using a fuel cell as an APU in a transport aircraft very 
challenging. Many technical teams have for over a decade studied the possibility of using a fuel 
cell as an APU. Some of those challenges were articulated in a NASA report: NASA/CR—2006-
214458/VOL1. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell APU Feasibility Study for a Long Range Commercial Aircraft 
Using UTC ITAPS Approach. Volume 1; Aircraft Propulsion and Subsystems Integration 
Evaluation. 

•  The SOFC system specific power (kW/kg) is about three times lower than that of a 

conventional gas turbine APU. The corresponding weight penalty increases the amount of 
fuel burned by the aircraft (equivalent of 0.4 percent aircraft mission fuel burn). 

•  The SOFC system operation during cruise condition requires input air stream and providing 
that air from the ambient (ram air) introduces ram-drag penalty. This ram-drag penalty 
increases the amount of fuel burned by the aircraft (equivalent of 0.3 percent aircraft 
mission fuel burn). 

•  The SOFC system (which is a hybrid system with the SOFC stack and the turbo-machinery) 
generates both ac and dc power. The dc power is from the stack and the ac power is from 

154 

 
the turbine generator. The distribution of the power (ac and dc) generated by the SOFC 
system in the aircraft requires additional power electronics (power converters etc), which, 
in turn, increase the amount of fuel burned by the aircraft. 

•  The current technology of the SOFC system requires a longer time (more than 30 min) to 
startup the SOFC system. Therefore, frequent starting and stopping cycles for the SOFC 
system may not be a good option for the aircraft application. 

•  The processing of the Jet-A fuel with sulfur levels between 300 to 1000ppm requires a 

bulkier desulfurizer, which restricts the de-sulfurization options for the aircraft. 

•  The exhaust gas coming out of the SOFC system is at rather high temperature (> 600 °C) and 
utilization of this hot stream is a challenge. To realize any potential benefit from the SOFC 
system for aircraft application, the system integration concepts for the SOFC system should 
provide substantial benefits to overcome penalties imposed by the technical challenges 
listed above. 

With the continued move to the more electric aircraft, using electric start, and replacing many 
the hydraulic and pneumatic loads. Many of the challenges still exist but things have moved 
forward.

Realizing the benefit of using fuel cells as an APU requires a few paradigm shifts to offset its 
disadvantages: 

•  The aircraft power system architecture moves towards More Electric Architecture (MEA). 

•  Power and energy supply/demand must be optimized and integrated at aircraft level. 

•  FCAPU taking on more functionalities over the traditional one to become a primary, non-

propulsive power system. 

E.4.2  Future FCAPU Outlook 

For the fuel cell to be used as an APU requires a great deal of changes. The projected new 
system will likely expand beyond providing traditional functions.  It will combine or contribute 
to functionalities to become a Fuel Cell Power System (FCPS) that provides functions such as: 

•  Electrical power for flight deck, flight control, lighting, galley, in-flight entertainment 

•  ECS power/thermal management provide electric power to the higher coefficient of 

performance (COP) vapor cycle system (VCS) 

•  MES with starter/generator 

•  Cabin pressurization with electrically driven cabin air compressor 

•  Full time power to unload burden from the main engine for improved propulsive efficiency 

and operability 

•  Lavatory water replenishment from FCPS waste stream 

•  Cargo compartment fire suppression from FCPS waste ODA 

•  Distributed power for redundancy, 

•  Emergency power 

•  Emergency oxygen supply 

•  Fuel tank inerting 

• 

Icing protection 

•  Electric-Taxi 

When aircraft level energy and power demands are optimized, functions and equipment that 
can be potentially replace by the FCPS are: 

1.  Auxiliary Power Unit 

2.  Electric generators 

3.  Ram Air Turbine 

4.  Oxygen bottles 

156 

 
5.  Fire suppressant 

Major transport category airplane manufacturers have done a great deal of preliminary work on 
assessing the challenges of using a fuel cell as an APU. It is clear from their efforts that current 
technology will not provide a form fit and function replacement for the APU. Most of the 
scenarios that have been explored use both SOFC and PEMFC and/or a combination of both 
with electrical energy storage (mostly batteries). Figure 62 is one example of potential system 
configuration. 

Figure 62. Potential Aircraft Power System configuration 

Though the future FCPS will be highly integrated with other systems and replacing some 
existing systems, the combination of the possible system architecture is unlimited, it can be 
broken down and analyzed in these basic energy supply device groups: 

1.  SOFC with gas turbine hybrid for baseload, and will be analyzed as “form fit function” 

drop-in APU replacement 

157 

 
 
2.  Regenerative for load shaping, store energy during low power segment of the mission 

and augment the power supply during high power demand segment of the mission.  This 
may be analyzed the similar way as fuel cell emergency power supply. 

3.  Batteries for peak and transient shaving. 

Each of the above ESD groups can be analyzed independently and the interconnectivity will be 
part of the aircraft. 

Some of the main problem areas are in supplying the fuel for the fuel cell.  For stored hydrogen 
FC systems, the size and weight maybe prohibitive if it provides all power during the flight and 
ground operation, while it may be logistically challenging to compete with ground (gate or 
ground cart) power if it’s only used for ground operation at gate. 

While it would be best to use the same fuel as the engines, however the sulfur continent in the 
fuel requires additional processing stage to provide a usable fuel for the fuel cell, which adds 
weight, volume, and maintenance frequency.  Other solutions would be to partition fuel tank 
for ultra-low sulfur fuel or bio-fuel storage dedicated for the fuel cell operation, this fuel can be 
blended with kerosene fuel for gas turbine engines when reserve fuel is needed. 

E.4.3  PEM Fuel Cell Power System 

As stated at the beginning of this section, the FC APU in this section is assumed to be a form fit 
function drop-in replacement that uses the same fuel as the main engines.  Since there is no 
gaseous hydrogen refilling infrastructure in all airports, SOFC systems with onboard fuel 
reformation involve more interfaces with the aircraft, becomes the technology of choice for the 
purpose of discussion. 

However, with the advancement of fuel cell power system technology in passenger 
automobiles the PEM fuel cell power system has matured and the specific power has improved 
to a point where it starts to make sense for airplane implementation consideration, only if 
certain conditions are met: 

1.  Hydrogen refilling infrastructure exist in all air commercial transport airports wherever 

the FCAPU equipped airplanes fly, worldwide. 

2.  Air transport airplanes made substantial modifications to minimize power demand on 

FCAPU to reduce the system size, e.g., the pneumatically powered systems such as main 
engine start (MES) and air cycle system (ACS) within the ECS. 

3.  These airplanes do not need ETOPS certification. 

4.  Operators of these airplanes will modify their operating procedures to minimize FCAPU 

run time between refilling to reduce the hydrogen fuel tank size and weight. 

158 

 
  APPLICATION: FUEL CELL EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEM 

The emergency power system provides power for the essential loads when both the normal 
sources of electrical power fail (e.g., main engine generators and APU generators). 

On modern transport category airplanes emergency power is supplied by the Ram Air Turbine 
(RAT). This system consists of a wind powered turbine that drops out of the aircraft under in an 
emergency situation and may provide power at 28V DC or 115V AC 3 phase, in addition some 
designs include a hydraulic output. These systems provide sufficient power for the essential 
loads such as minimal instrumentation and control of the flight surfaces. 

Some RAT’s cannot be deployed at altitude due to the mechanical load on the aircraft and so 
the aircraft reduces its altitude to around 25,000 feet before deploying. This shortens the glide 
time if thrust has also been lost. At low air speeds the RAT usually become ineffective so the 
function is taken over by batteries (e.g., on landing approach). 

To make comparisons the example FCS will be a 15 kVA 115V AC 3 Phase system supplying only 
electrical power. The PEM fuel cell system to support this function may need to operate for 3 
hours to meet ETOPS requirements. 

This example FCS will require around 2.7 kg of hydrogen. A tank pressurized to 700 bar or solid 
hydrogen fuel source will weigh around 42 kg.  This is close to the weight of the entire 
equivalent RAT system.  A fuel cell replacement system in today’s technologies would weigh 2 
to 3 times that of the RAT. However, there are still advantages in using a PEM FCS. 

The fuel cell system would consist of fuel cell, a fuel supply, an oxidant, a cooling system and 
electrical conditioning. Although the volume of the system would be greater than the 
equivalent RAT, the elements could be distributed around the aircraft rather than contained as 
a single entity. 

The hydrogen supplied can be derived from either a 700-bar pressurized type 3 tank or a solid 
hydrogen solid fuel store which operates at or below 12 bar. Although more expensive, the 
solid hydrogen fuel store has the advantage of containing the hydrogen in an inert state over an 
extended period of time and only requires a low pressure supporting system. 

The oxidant can be provided by a high-pressure tank, similar to those already installed on an 
aircraft or by an air scoop/ram air input, or even generated on board in a similar way to the 
solid fuel store. The system will require around 900 liters of air per minute or around 
36,000 liters of oxygen (50-liter tank at 700 bar) delivered between 4 °C and 60 °C. 

Approximately for each kW of electrical energy generated a kW of heat will need to be 
dissipated by the cooling system. Ram air is a convenient method if it is a chosen method for 
the oxidant as the outside temperature is low.  It should be noted that up to 6x the volume of 
the oxidant is required for the cooling air 

159 

 
The electrical conditioning system converts the varying DC output of the fuel cell to a 
conditioned 3 phase AC output. In order to provide stable energy an element of energy storage 
will be required either in the form of super-caps/batteries or magnetics (iron). 

All by-products (e.g., water, heat, O2) would be exhausted. 

The startup time (usually about 10 minutes) could be an issue for emergency power, so it is 
likely that the system will be kept at hot standby in flight.  Once in standby, the time to 
operational state is on the order of a few seconds, less than of the deployment of the RAT and 
can either be executed under pilot control or automatically. 

Compared to the RAT, the fuel cell system will be able to operate at much higher altitudes and 
provides power continuously at any altitude leading to a longer glide time.  However, at very 
low air speeds, the cooling capability may be affected dependent on its design. 

A further advantage is that the fuel cell system can be turned off (and restarted if required), the 
RAT however, cannot be retracted once deployed so it will continue to disrupt the 
aerodynamics of the aircraft. 

The fuel cell system can be exercised periodically, both in flight using a small quantity of the 
stored hydrogen, or on the ground using an auxiliary supply, whereas the RAT requires 
downtime to test/maintain the system which, to some operators, may be a significant 
inconvenience. 

In terms of safety, the lack of external rotational components is a benefit of the fuel cell system 
but clearly the careful handling of the fuel, oxidant and potentially high pressures need to be 
considered. 

E.5.1  Emergency Power System Aircraft Interfaces 

All the interfaces to the aircraft are summarized in Table 15.  This system is classified as Critical 
to the aircraft, but the overall level of integration is probably less than an APU, depending on 
the oxygen supply and the heat rejection.

  UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS) PROPULSION 

There is a growing interest in UASs in the both the military and commercial sectors. This 
increase in interest has resulted in UAS capable of a wide range of uses, both for personal and 
commercial applications. This has driven a strong demand for access within the National 
Airspace System (NAS).  Figure 63 shows some UAS’s which are in use today.  Figure 64 shows 
an example UAV with a PEMFC power system.  Fuel cells have been under consideration for 
UAS applications as a high energy prime electric power and propulsion system source to extend 
UAS flight durations.   

161 

 
E.6.1  UAS Class Designation by U.S. Military 

We will first define the different classes of UASs to outline the applicable fuel cell types and 
fueling solutions. Following are the definition used by the US military, these size classes can be 
defined as follows: 

•  Group 1 

o  0-20lb gross take-off weight (GTOW) for the vehicle 
o  Flight ceiling limited to <1200ft AGL (above ground level) 
o  Flight speed <100knots 

•  Group 2 

o  21-55lbs GTOW 
o  Flight ceiling limited to <3500ft AGL 
o  Flight speed <250knots 

•  Group 3 

o  <1320lbs GTOW 
o  Flight ceiling limited to <FL180 AGL (or 18,000ft) 
o  Flight speed <250knots 

•  Group 4 

o  >1320lbs GTOW 
o  Flight ceiling limited to <FL180 AGL 

•  Group 5 

o  >1320lbs GTOW 
o  Flight ceiling >FL180 AGL 

E.6.2  Fuel Cell Types Based on UAS Class Designation 

Groups 1 and 2 UAS are common in the hobby, commercial and military markets and are 
typically hand or rail-launched systems. Traditionally, these vehicles are powered by a battery 
or small commercial internal combustion engine fueled by gasoline or other specialty fuel. 
Power levels typically range from <100W to up to 5kW for required flight, operating voltage 
commonly range from 12 to 48V. Within this size class of vehicle, both proton exchange 
membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been considered. Due to 
the difference in fuel cell type, operating start-up procedures may vary but typically include the 
following: fuel cell start/warm-up, perform flight check procedures for UAS, and then launch 
once the fuel cell is in a ready state. The fuel cell start/warm-up procedures and times will vary 
based on the type, size, and design of the fuel cell.  Generally, low temperature PEMFCs can 

162 

 
provide power more immediately (e.g. 0 to 2-minute start times) than a higher temperature 
SOFC (e.g. > 10 minutes for an SOFC).  Landing/shut-down procedures are much the same: The 
FCS can be placed in stand-by mode upon landing (if re-launch/re-fueling required) or proceed 
to the shut-down state where fuel flow will be stopped and fuel lines purged upon cooldown 
for safe storage and future restart. Note: the fuel cell can be designed to allow for “hot swap” 
fuel cartridges while the fuel cell is in standby mode to avoid complete system cooldown if re-
launch required. 

For the smaller Group 1 UASs, the fuel cell power system would be a replacement for the 
battery that is more commonly used, and the fueling solution considered disposable. Due to the 
weight and volume constraints in Group 1 UAS, man developmental efforts have used H2 fueled 
PEMFCs since they traditionally have exhibited higher system power density (in terms of W/kg). 
A discussion on the H2 fuel sources solution are discussed in other sections. If logistically 
feasible, compressed H2 can be used but is typically limited by storage capacity, i.e. ~2 wt% H2 
storage. 

Metal hydride or liquid H2 systems have additional complexities and weight challenges for this 
size class of vehicle. Chemical hydrides (chemical H2 storage, e.g. sodium borohydride) have 
been used to extend flight durations due to their higher H2 storage capacity, (i.e. 5-10 wt% H2). 

There are various safety considerations with any of these fuel types.  Appendices D and F 
provide a more detailed discussion on this topic. Maintaining proper safety protocols and 
considerations of the flight environment should be forefront when integrating and operating 
fuel cell UASs. Current Group 1 and 2 UASs operate within line of sight to avoid any safety 
incidents such as loss of aircraft or communications. More automated UASs are typically 
designed with warning and cautions to alert the operator of any operational issues. An example 
of this could be low fuel warnings and limits where the vehicle would be automatically directed 
into a landing condition to avoid a safety event leading to loss of aircraft before any critical 
flight power is disrupted. Since this class of vehicles typically belly land in a cleared space 
(without landing gear), proper safety protection should be in place to avoid any damage to the 
fuel cell or fuel tank upon landing. 

For the larger Group 2 UASs, where generally greater than 1kW power is required for flight 
power, solid oxide fuel cells have more commonly been considered due to their high operating 
efficiencies and fuel flexibility. The traditional propulsion system on this size of UAS is an 
internal combustion engine operating on liquid hydrocarbon or specialty fuel. PEMFC-powered 
UAS with compressed or liquid H2 fueling solutions have been flight demonstrated. SOFC-based 
power systems operating on liquid hydrocarbon fuel are under development for extended flight 
operations. A discussion on the unique safety considerations for these systems is included in 
Appendices D and F. Since these UASs are typically rail- or bungee-launched (and either belly 
land or air-captured), proper safety considerations must be accounted for in the design and 
integration of the fuel cell to be able handle the required shock and accelerations loads. Due to 
the size of these vehicles, and to maintain a safe flight environment, proper flight and power 
controls/monitoring should be in place to maintain control in the case of an emergency to avoid 
any safety events. 

163 

 
Larger Group 3 SOFC-based UAS power systems are currently under development and have 
been flight tested for long endurance operations. Due to the amount of energy required for 
flight, liquid hydrocarbon fueled systems are typically considered for this application. To 
minimize size/weight of the power system, the fuel cell systems are typically hybridized with a 
battery in most cases. In this situation, the fuel cell is sized to provide cruise power and 
onboard power as required (e.g., avionics, payload, battery charging), while a battery is 
electrically connected in parallel to support peak power requirements (e.g., take-off, dash). As 
discussed in the preceding paragraphs, similar hybrid approaches have been developed for 
Group1 and 2 UASs. 

The propulsion systems for Group 4 and 5 UASs are typically engine-based. However, as the 
demand for more electric power continues to grow, these systems are quickly becoming power-
limited. Fuel cells have been considered as a high efficiency power source to provide more 
electric onboard power as an APU, providing non-flight critical power. To avoid a secondary fuel 
onboard and further safety requirements, these fuel cell systems are being designed to operate 
on the same fuel source as the main engine.

E.6.3  U.S. Navy Ion Tiger Program 

The U.S. Navy Ion Tiger program is one of several DoD initiatives to demonstrate a practical, 
lightweight fuel cell system for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to significantly improve 
battlefield surveillance and communications capabilities.  Figure 65 and Figure 66 provide an 
overview of the program. 

165

Figure 66. Ion Tiger Fuel Cell-Powered UAV 

Ion Tiger’s electric fuel cell power system has the low noise and thermal signature of a battery-
powered UAV, while taking advantage of the fuel cell’s high operating efficiency on high energy 
hydrogen fuel. The 550-W (0.75-horsepower) fuel cell has about four times the efficiency of a 
comparable internal combustion engine. The Ion Tiger flew for 26 hours in November 2009 
while carrying a 5-pound payload using hydrogen compressed to 5000-psi in a 
carbon/aluminum pressure vessel. In May 2013, the same researchers at the U.S. Naval 
Research Laboratory flew their fuel cell powered Ion Tiger UAV for 48-hours and 1 minute on 
April 16-18 by using liquid hydrogen fuel in a new, NRL-developed, cryogenic fuel storage tank 
and delivery system. These 1-day and 2-day demonstrations prove that hydrogen fuel cells 
provides a clear path to long endurance electric flight.  In comparison, the Ion Tiger would be 
able to fly for only 4 hours on the comparable weight of lithium batteries. 

E.6.4  UAS Aircraft Interfaces 

A fuel cell must be designed for the intended operational environment and requires a high 
degree of integration with the UAS vehicle in order to obtain its benefits of high operational 
efficiency.  Classification of Failure Condition shows an overview of expected interfaces.

For smaller UASs (Groups 1-3), fuel cells 
would be the main power source the

fuel cell may ideally provide auxiliary power. 
A battery may be used as part of the fuel cell 
system for start-up, peak power, or

operator, with warnings, cautions, and 
alerts to notify the ground operator of an 
issue in flight, such as a low fuel / power 
warning or loss of communication link. More

 FUEL CELL SYSTEM HAZARDS 

  INTRODUCTION 

The main airworthiness standard to be satisfied regarding fuel cell system design hazards is 
CFR/CS 25.1309. The hazard consideration should be made in accordance with SAE ARP 4754 
(Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems) and ARP 4761 (Guidelines and 
Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and 
Equipment). This identifies design hazards as well as interface requirements to other systems as 
installation risks. 

Based on the criticality of the system/sub-system the related design assurance level has to be 
determined according to ARP 4754 and the hazards need to be analyzed in accordance with 
ARP 4761. As oxygen and hydrogen do have specific hazards, design consideration should be 
extended by a dedicated oxygen hazard and hydrogen hazard analysis. These analyses should 
consider specific design hazards for all sub-systems (i.e., oxygen, hydrogen, fuel cell stack, 
pressure vessels, etc.) including system integration into the aircraft environment. 

The location the fuel cell system installation in the aircraft can greatly affect the hazard 
mitigation approaches. 

Hydrogen currently is not used as a fuel in civil aviation. The predominant and most feared 
hazard that can be created by hydrogen is fire or explosion. However, the aviation community 
has significant experience with compressed gas in the form of oxygen, which is well covered in 
today’s regulations. Similar hazard mitigation principles can therefore be applied with specific 
care to ensure that the fire/explosion risk of hydrogen is properly managed. 

The minimum ignition energy for a wide range of hydrogen concentrations in air or oxygen is 
very low.  Therefore, in contrast to traditional fuel air mixtures, the avoidance of a dedicated 
ignition source will not be sufficient to mitigate the fire risk. The only feasible method to 
extinguish a hydrogen fire is to stop the supply of hydrogen.  Traditional extinguishing methods 
will not suffice. 

However, unlike traditional aircraft fuel tanks, a hydrogen tank will not contain a fuel air 
mixture but rather pure hydrogen. The lack of air, or oxygen ensures that the compressed gas 
within the hydrogen tank is not flammable. 

As a result, the primary design methods to prevent hydrogen fire hazards are the separation of 
hydrogen and any oxidizer, preventing the accumulation of flammable mixtures and ensuring 
effective hydrogen detection and shut-off means as last line of defense. 

  HYDROGEN FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS 

This section introduces the hazards related to the fire, ignition, combustion, explosion, and 
unique H2 properties. 

171 

 
Experience shows that escaped hydrogen is very easily ignited (NASA, 1997). Ignition sources 
include mechanical sparks from rapidly closing valves, electrostatic discharges in ungrounded 
particulate filters, sparks from electrical equipment, catalyst particles, heating equipment, 
lightning strikes near the vent stack, etc. Ignition sources must be eliminated or isolated in 
appropriate way and operations should be conducted as if unforeseen ignition sources could 
occur. 

The ignition energy of hydrogen-air mixture varies with its composition, and becomes infinite at 
the flammability limits. Less energy is needed to ignite a mixture that is closer to its 
stoichiometric composition. Over the flammable range of hydrogen-air mixtures, the ignition 
energy varies by almost three orders of magnitude. The minimum ignition energy (MIE) is 0.017 
mJ for the most ignitable mixture.  In addition, to the mixture composition, the ignition energy 
depends on other factors such as the initial pressure and temperature of the environment. 
Ignition sources capable of forming shocks, for example high-energy spark discharges and high 
explosives, can directly initiate detonation. 

Hydrogen has very wide flammability limits, which range from approximately 4% to 75% at sea 
level.  At altitude, while the rich limit collapses somewhat, the lean limit remains at 
approximately 4%.  This combined with the low MIE necessary for ignition, provides for the 
challenge of safely designing a hydrogen system and adequately mitigating its risks.  The 
following chapters will explain in detail the flammability hazards associated with hydrogen as 
well as typical mitigation strategies. 

F.2.1  Hydrogen Combustion 

Hydrogen combustion hazards are characterized by mixture flammability, the presence and 
type of ignition sources, and the type of combustion process possible for the conditions. As 
with any fuel, for a fire to be possible the following elements must occur simultaneously, as 
shown in Figure 67: 

•  A flammable chemical, with a concentration within its flammability limits; 

•  An oxidant, at a concentration putting the combustible in its flammable range; and 

•  A thermal or electrical ignition source having some minimum energy. 

Note: Ignition is the starting of a fire while burning represents the continuous process of the 
fire. 

172 

 
Figure 67. Fire Triangle 

There are a number of hydrogen hazard scenarios in which the ignition energy is inherent in the 
mixing process and therefore the resulting combustion is described as spontaneous. 

The auto-ignition temperature of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it will 
spontaneously ignite without the presence of a flame or spark. The auto-ignition temperatures 
of hydrogen and natural gas are very similar. Both have auto-ignition temperatures over 538 °C 
(1,000 °F), much higher than the auto-ignition temperature of gasoline vapor, as shown in 
Figure 68. 

173 

 
 
Figure 68. Auto Ignition Temperature (Value in Fahrenheit) 

Hydrogen's flammability range (between 4% and 75% in standard atmosphere) is very wide 
compared to other fuels, as shown in Figure 69. Under the optimal combustion condition (a 
29% hydrogen-to-air volume ratio), the ignition energy required to initiate hydrogen 
combustion is much lower than that required for other common fuels (e.g., a small spark will 
ignite it), as shown in Figure 70. However, at low concentrations of hydrogen in air, the ignition 
energy required to initiate combustion is similar to that of other fuels. 

174 

 
 
Figure 69. Flammability Range and Ignition Energy Versus Concentration 

Figure 70. Minimum Ignition Energy at Stoichiometric Conditions 

Hydrogen burns with a pale blue flame that is nearly invisible in daylight, so it is almost 
impossible to detect by the human senses. Impurities such as other burning materials and dust 
will introduce color to the hydrogen flame. At night, hydrogen flames are visible. The adiabatic 
flame temperature of a hydrogen/air mixture can reach 2045°C (3712°F) while the adiabatic 
flame temperature of a hydrogen/oxygen mixture can reach ≈ 3200°C (5792 °F). Therefore, 
hydrogen/air mixture is very similar to Jet A-1 which has its max adiabatic flame temperature of 
approximately 2200 °C, while a hydrogen/oxygen mixture results in a significantly higher 
adiabatic flame temperature. (Proceedings of ASME GT2009-60333) 

Additionally, hydrogen flames radiate little infrared (IR) heat, but substantial ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation. This means that when someone is very close to a hydrogen flame, there is little 

175 

 
 
 
sensation of heat, making inadvertent contact with the flame a significant concern. The heat 
transmission of a H2 jet fire will occur at 93% by convection and at 7% by radiation. 

This is to be compared to a hydrocarbon jet fire where 70% of the heat transfer to an impinged 
object occurs by convection and also to a hydrocarbon pool fire where approximately 70% of 
the heat transfer to an impinged object occurs by thermal radiation and 30% by convection. 

Hydrogen’s low emissivity reduces the heat transferred by radiation to objects near the flame, 
thus reducing the risks of secondary ignitions although the flame temperatures of hydrogen 
and the other common fuels are comparable. 

If a large hydrogen cloud comes into contact with an ignition source, ignition will result in the 
flame flashing back to the source of the hydrogen. In open spaces with no confinement, flames 
will propagate through a flammable hydrogen-air cloud at several meters per second. The 
result is a rapid release of heat, with little overpressure and a combustion product of steam. 
However, if hydrogen gas mixtures enter confined regions flammable limits are reached more 
easily due to the loss of dilution effects, ignition is very likely and can result in flame 
acceleration and generation of high pressures. Flammable mixtures of hydrogen intrinsic to the 
fuel cell system in confinements (e.g.  inside pipes or ducts), if ignited, will readily result in 
accelerated flames and conditions that can transition to detonation. 

A stoichiometric mixture is a mixture in which both fuel and oxidizer are fully consumed 
(complete combustion) to form combustion product(s). For example, the two diatomic gases, 
hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), can combine to form water as the only product of an 
exothermic reaction between them, as described by the equation 

2H2 + O2 = 2H2O 

Thus, the stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture is composed of 66.66% by volume of 
hydrogen and 33.33% of oxygen. Therefore, the stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen in air 
(assuming 21% of oxygen and 79% of nitrogen) is 29.59% by volume (2 / (2+1+3.76) = 0.2959) 
with air content of 70.41%. 

Hydrogen’s main safety asset is its buoyancy which confers hydrogen the ability to rapidly flow 
out and mix with the ambient air to a safe level below the LFL. Hydrogen has a density of 
0.0838 kg/m3 which is far below than air density of 1.205 kg/m3 (NTP). The unwanted 
consequences of a hydrogen release into the open atmosphere, and in partially confined 
geometries, are drastically reduced by buoyancy. 

However, the cold, dense hydrogen gases produced by LH2 spills will not rise. The higher 
density of saturated vapor may cause a hydrogen cloud to flow horizontally or downward 
immediately upon release if an LH2 spill or leak occurs, 

The rapid release of a volume of hydrogen creates a “bubble” that under ambient conditions 
and release into an unconfined region will rise at rates varying from 1.2 to 9 m/s (McCarty et 
al.1981) depending on hydrogen gas and atmospheric conditions. 

176 

 
F.2.2  Type of Hydrogen Fires 

F.2.2.1  Hydrogen Jet Fire 

Hydrogen jets resulting from high pressure storage tanks and equipment of between 350-700 
bar will be mainly in a form of under-expanded jets, defined as a jet with pressure at the nozzle 
exit which is above the atmospheric pressure. The jet will have air at its edges and can combust 
in a jet flame, which is similar to a Bunsen burner flame. To limit the hazard associated to a jet 
fire, the feed line pressure and diameter of a pipe and restrictor orifice should, by design, limit 
the mass flow rate of hydrogen to a technological level that is required for the FC to function. 
(i.e. restrictor or feed line diameter as small as possible, high pressure component as limited as 
possible). Figure 71 provides a tool to evaluate the potential flame length resulting from 
hydrogen stored at a given pressure and a leaking diameter. (Molkov - University of Ulster) 

Figure 71 Flame Length Determination: Diagram and Experimental Values 

Ex. a 3mm hole in a 350 bar pressurized 
component could lead to a flame of 5 m length. 

177 

 
 
In the context of hydrogen high pressure component, due consideration shall be given to the 
high momentum jet release that could hit surrounding objects. Such jet releases can lead to 
ablation of any passive fire protection material and cascading effects resulting from the burning 
of that material. 

178 

 
 
F.2.2.2 

 Microflames 

A small leak in a hydrogen system could ignite, burn undetected for a long time, and potentially 
degrade surrounding materials or ignite any hydrogen release that may occur nearby (Butler et 
al., 2009). Hydrogen leaks can support combustion at flow rates much lower than leaks of other 
gaseous fuels. 

Report SAE J2579, (2009) states that a localized hydrogen leak from a typical compression 
fitting cannot sustain a flame (that can subsequently weaken material and cause a loss of 
containment), when the mass flow rate is below 28 μg/s. The report indicates that if a leak is 
below 28 μg/s, a sustained (micro) flame at the leak area will not occur and the released H2 will 
have to be addressed through ventilation and proper design to avoid accumulation. 

F.2.2.3  Hydrogen Deflagration 

Deflagration is a flame moving through a flammable mixture as a subsonic wave, with respect 
to the unburned mixture. Without confinement, laminar burning occurs with the flame front 
moving 2 to 3 m/s. Under these conditions pressure buildup can reach a factor of 8 times the 
initial pressure. Sensitive H2/air mixtures are characterized by hydrogen concentrations that 
exceed 12 percent by volume. (WST-IR-117-001-08 NASA). A deflagration explosion is the more 
likely event in an open gas cloud since the minimum volume concentration mixture to allow a 
deflagration is low, 4% in air for burning, and the minimum ignition energy is small, about 1 mJ 
at 4% concentration. 

Confined volumes in which the volume to surface area ratio is large, or volumes for which 
length ≈ width ≈ height do not promote significant flame acceleration. 

F.2.2.4  Hydrogen Deflagration Mitigation 

In confinements where the length/width ratio is less than 8 there is little acceleration of the 
flame speed so the design shall consider this recommendation. 

Ventilation is the main mitigation to avoid the H2 ignition leading to deflagration. 

F.2.2.5  Hydrogen Detonation 

The detonation process is initiated directly with a shock wave, or when conditions are right, a 
deflagration can transition to detonation in a process called deflagration-to-detonation 
transition. Detonations are characterized by high velocities and large overpressures. (WST-IR-
117-001-08 NASA). The detonation range mentioned in ISO/TR 15916 (2004) is 18-59% by 
volume of hydrogen in air. 

It is much more difficult to initiate a hydrogen detonation than a hydrogen fire, looking at the 
concentration and ignition energy levels. Today the probability of a fire on board an A/C is 
higher than 10E-7 while the probability of a detonation (e.g. fuel tank explosion prevention) 
needs to be better than 10E-9. 

179 

 
Causing a detonation in a gas cloud is difficult (compared to deflagration), since the minimum 
volume concentration for hydrogen is 18% in air and the ignition energy is in the 10 kJ range.  
Therefore, initiating a detonation in a hydrogen cloud is not as likely as initiating a deflagration. 

Detonations are characterized by high velocities (1500 m/s (4922 ft/s) or greater) and large 
overpressures, as great as 15 to 120 times the initial pressure. (WSTF-IR-1117-001-08) 

F.2.2.6  Hydrogen Detonation Mitigation 

The detonation cell width, often denoted as lambda (λ), is a fundamental parameter of the 
detonation process found to be proportional to the chemical reaction zone length (length of the 
area where the chemical reaction is occurring). Indeed, a diameter of the tube, where 
detonation can propagate, should be of the order of a detonation cell size. The length, a, of a 
detonation cell is one to two times its width, b. The aspect ratio, a/b, increases with decreasing 
initial pressure. Detonation cell lengths for stoichiometric GH2-air/GOX at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) 
are 15.9 mm (0.626 in.) and 0.6 mm (0.024 in.), respectively (Bull, Ellsworth, and Shiff 1982). 

The detonation cell size is a function of a mixture composition. Figure 72 shows results of the 
classical work by Lee on dependence of detonation cell size on concentration of hydrogen in air 
(Lee, 1982). 

Figure 72. Detonation Cell Size as A Function of Hydrogen Concentration in Air 

180 

 
 
The cell size is a parameter that can limit detonations. For smooth tubes, the smallest tube 
diameter that will propagate a detonation is = (cell size/π). Larger diameters will propagate a 
detonation shock wave, but smaller diameters cannot because the reflected shock waves will 
break up the primary wave front. For a stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture, the minimum tube 
diameter is about 0.5 cm (Guirao, 1989). At the upper and lower explosion limits, the minimum 
tube diameter is about 0.3 meter. Propagation of a detonation in a channel requires that the 
channel width be at least as wide as the cell size. A similar phenomenon with flame quenching 
is seen for hydrogen flames. If two plates are closer than 0.5 mm, a hydrogen flame cannot 
propagate because too much heat is lost to the walls for the flame to sustain itself. 

It is possible to ignite a deflagration that can “run up” or transition to a detonation. This is 
referred to a deflagration-to-detonation transition, or DDT. 

Figure 73. Typical Example of Acceleration of Flame to Detonation Conditions 

The experimentally observed run-up distance for DDT in stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture in 
a tube has typical length to diameter ratio of approximately 100. The presence of obstacles in a 
tube can essentially reduce run-up distance for DDT.  Run up distances for DDT in sensitive 
mixtures could be ≈ ½ meter 

The following are strategies that could be implemented to minimize the potential for flame 
acceleration or detonation within a fuel cell: 

•  Avoiding confinement and congestion where flammable hydrogen-air mixtures might form; 

181 

 
 
•  Using flame arrestors, small orifices, or channels to prevent deflagration and detonation 

from propagating within a system; 

Limit the amount of hydrogen that can escape through a leak by limiting the high-pressure 
portion of the hydrogen supply system to the minimum. The feed line pressure and diameter of 
a pipe and restrictor orifice should, by design, limit the mass flow rate of hydrogen to a 
technological level that is required for the FC to function. As a good practice, the high-pressure 
line should be minimized. The release duration, due to the time required to detect the leak and 
operate the valve should be reduced as much as possible. The leak detection time and time of 
shutting down hydrogen supply line is therefore a critical parameter for safety. 

F.2.2.7  Mitigation of Fire Hazard—Quenching Gap for Isolating Fire 

The quenching gap is defined as the spark gap between two flat parallel-plate electrodes at 
which ignition of combustible fuel air mixtures is suppressed; smaller gaps totally suppress 
spark ignition. The quenching gap is the passage gap dimension requirement to prevent 
propagation of an open flame through a flammable fuel air mixture that fills the passage. (WST-
IR-117-001-08 NASA). Quenching of any flame occurs when heat losses from flame are 
comparable with heat generation due to combustion, and then the chemical reactions cannot 
be sustained. 

The quenching distance decreases with increase of pressure and temperature, and is highly 
dependent on the mixture composition. This is probably the main reason of the published data 
scattering. 

ISO TR 15916 provides a quenching gap value of 0.064 cm (for 20°C, 15 K and 101,325 kPa). 

Figure 74. Effect of Pressure Concentration and Pressure on Quenching Distance 

(NACA report 1383) 

182 

 
 
The quenching gap is one of the key parameter that is used to design a flame arrestor which 
might be used to prevent a hydrogen fire propagating from one A/C zone to another or outside 
the aircraft. 

F.2.2.8  Mitigation of Fire Ignition—Explosion Proofness 

Components located in flammable fluid leakage or fire zones should be qualified to show that 
they are not nominal ignition sources. Electrical components may be qualified for use within 
flammable fluid leakage zones by showing the components meets the appropriate criteria such 
as the explosion proof requirements defined in section 9 of RTCA Document DO-160/ED14. 
Other components must be shown to be free of potential arcing or friction ignition sources and 
have maximum surface temperatures with margin below the autogenous ignition temperature 
of the flammable fluid that could exist within the zone. Components located in flammable fluid 
leakage should be qualified to show that they are not being ignition sources or that they are 
intrinsically safe. 

Note: Explosion proof test sequence requirements as defined in section 9 of 
RTCA Document DO-160/ED14 might need to be adapted to the hydrogen 
environment. Other standard, used in industry, could be acceptable pending 
comparison analysis. 

F.2.2.9  Mitigation of Fire Ignition—Gas Leakage Detection 

Hydrogen Sensor response time, resolution and accuracy needs to be adequate for the 
measurement intent.  Impacting factors include pressure levels, humidity, temperature, 
vibration, etc. need to be considered in the design and qualification of the sensor. (AIR6464, 
AS/ARP for fuel cell).  In event of a failure, shut off action shall be initiated for any non-essential 
application. 

Hydrogen sensors when ensuring FC safety should have periodic maintenance & calibration to 
maintain in-service performance. 

F.2.2.10  Mitigation of Fire Ignition—Ventilation 

Ventilation is one mitigation means to reduce the risk associated to a hydrogen fire. In general 
leaking hydrogen must be vented overboard unless it can be shown that no hazard exists by its 
discharge within the compartment in which it is installed. Hazard associated with the loss of 
ventilation are to be considered in the design and safety analysis. 

Ventilation is as well one mitigation means to face the risk of permeation due to hydrogen 
storage. During fuel cell operation, ventilation will probably be used to manage possible leaks 
however, for non-operating condition where ventilation is reduced or stopped, it is important 
to define maximum allowable permeation rate for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles with compressed 
hydrogen tanks onboard to define when LFL of hydrogen in air (4% by volume) is reached. 

183 

 
Permeation in the context of compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH) 2 systems is diffusion 
through the walls or interstices of a container vessel, piping or interface material. Permeation 
may be categorized as a long term slow hydrogen release from a CGH 2 system. For metallic 
containers or containers with metallic liners, i.e. Types 1, 2 or 3, the permeation rate is 
considered to be negligible. However, hydrogen permeation is an issue for containers with non-
metallic (polymer) liners, i.e. Type 4 containers. 

All these vessel types are suitable for aviation use, while for weight reasons type 3 or 4 will 
most probably be selected. In any case the permeation rate will need to be verified by analysis 
or test 

F.2.2.11  Mitigation of Fire Hazard—Flammability of Materials in Potential Leakage Areas of 

Hydrogen 

The material flammability shall be such that a sustained fire will not be supported after 
electrical power and the fuel and oxidant supply have been terminated. 

The slow leak rates that result from diffusion or permeation through a material do not pose a 
flammability hazard if the hydrogen is allowed to dissipate in the open. (NASA WSTF-IR-1117-
001-08) 

In case of higher leak or concentration due to permeation, Hydrogen concentration below LFL 
can have a significant impact on material fires.  As hydrogen increases from zero (0) to four 
percent (4%), materials: 

•  can no longer self-extinguish, 

•  burn at a faster rate 

•  are consumed at a faster rate 

This behavior is similar to what occurs in potential leakage areas of oxygen, although the 
severity of its impact may be increased. 

F.2.2.12  Mitigation of Fire Hazard—Separation of Leakage from Ignition Sources (Nominal 

and Potential) 

Separation of leakage and ignition sources is a fundamental tool in minimizing the probability 
for ignition, particularly with respect to preventing a single failure from causing both leakage 
and ignition. An arc fault between an electrical wire and a metallic flammable fluid line may 
puncture the line and result in a serious fire. The same applies to electrical equipment. When 
wiring is run parallel to or crossing flammable fluid lines, maintain as much physical separation 
as possible. 

184 

 
F.2.2.13  Mitigation of Fire Hazard—Isolation of Leakage from Ignition Sources (Nominal and 

Potential) 

As far as practical Isolation of flammable reactants leakage (such as H2) and ignition sources 
should be separated with a barrier. If this cannot be achieved, other precautions should be 
taken such as double walled hydrogen lines, vapor barriers, ventilation, etc. 

F.2.3  Potential Ignition Sources 

This section discusses the potential of H2 ignition from electrical, mechanical, and thermal 
sources. 

F.2.3.1 

Ignition Due to Electrical Sources 

F.2.3.1.1  Static Discharge 

The energy stored as static electricity on an object varies depending on the size of the object 
and its capacitance, the voltage to which it is charged, and the dielectric constant of the 
surrounding medium 

Example: the accumulation of electrostatic charges created by the friction of dry hydrogen 
flowing over, or through, nonmetals. Two-phase flow or flow with solid particles can cause a 
static discharge. 

Minimum Spark Energy for Ignition for H2 in Air is 0.017 mJ at 101.3 kPa. The potential for static 
discharge should be eliminated by proper bonding and grounding. 

The spark from a human electrostatic discharge can be up to 500 times that needed to ignite 
hydrogen. This energy is typically discharged in less than a microsecond and sufficient to ignite 
not only near stoichiometric mixtures yet mixtures close to the flammability limits. 

F.2.3.1.2  Electric Arc 

Electric arcs can provide the energy to ignite a combustible mixture of hydrogen and 
air/oxygen. Some examples of sources of electric arcs include switching circuits, electric motors 
and short circuits, loose connections. Large electric arcs create shockwaves sufficient to directly 
initiate detonation. (WST-IR-117-001-08 NASA) 

F.2.3.1.3  Charge Accumulation 

Electric charge buildup (Figure 75) is a function of the relative rates of charge accumulation and 
charge dissipation within the flowing fluid. 

185 

 
Figure 75. Electric Charge Buildup 

Electric charge buildup is very small for flowing hydrogen, but solid particles in the flow could 
greatly increase the buildup of an electric charge. 

The buildup of an electric charge could cause a spark that could result in an ignition of a 
combustible mixture of hydrogen and air/oxygen. (WST-IR-117-001-08 NASA). For this reason, 
all hydrogen conveying equipment must be thoroughly grounded. 

F.2.3.1.4 

Ignition Energy 

The mere fact that a spark results from high voltage does not mean that ignition of a flammable 
mixture will occur. For combustion to be initiated, sufficient energy must be transferred from 
the spark to the surrounding flammable mixture. The energy that is stored and available from a 
capacitive discharge is related to voltage and capacitance by the following formula: 

E = O.5CV2 

Where, 

E = energy (in joules) 

C = capacitance (in farads) 

V = potential (in volts) 

The minimum spark ignition energy for hydrogen in air has been reported as 0.016 mJ. This 
would equate to a voltage of less than 2 kV for a human with a typical capacitance of 100 pF. 
Such voltages could readily be obtained by a person and the discharge itself would be barely 
noticeable. 

186 

 
 
F.2.3.1.5 

Ignition by Static Electricity 

For an electrostatic charge to be a source of ignition, the following four conditions must be 
met12 

1.  A means of generating an electrostatic charge must be present. 

2.  A means of accumulating an electrostatic charge capable of producing an incendive 

spark. 

3.  A means of discharging the accumulated electrostatic charge in the form of an incendive 

spark (that is, a spark gap) must be present. 

4.  An ignitable vapor-air mixture must be present in the spark gap. 

F.2.3.1.6  Stray electrical current 

Stray currents can flow in electrically conductive systems or parts of systems: 

•  As a result of short circuit or short circuit to earth owing to faults in electrical installations. 

•  As a result of magnetic induction (near electrical installations with high current or radio 

frequency). 

F.2.3.1.7  Lightning 

At the point of a lightning strike there is a powerful electric discharge. The electric potential can 
be transmitted on long distances if conveyed by metallic pipes such as pipes. 

F.2.3.1.8  Corona Discharges 

Corona discharges are not discrete spark discharges, like capacitive or brush discharges, but are 
a quasi-constant current emitted from a pointed object that is at a different potential to its 
surroundings. The corona current is initiated when the potential is high enough to cause the 
local electric field to exceed a threshold value which depends upon curvature of the point. 

F.2.3.1.9  Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Waves up to 1011 Hz 

Radiofrequency (RF) waves will induce electric currents and voltages in any conducting 
structure on which they impinge. The magnitude of the currents and voltages will depend upon 
the size and shape of the structure, and the wavelength and strength of the RF signal.

F.2.3.1.10  Electromagnetic Waves from 3 x 1011 Hz to 3 x 1015 Hz13 

Radiation in this spectral range can be a source of ignition, especially when focused, through 
absorption by explosive atmospheres or solid particles. 

F.2.3.2 

Ignition Due to Mechanical Sources 

Some mechanical sources capable of igniting hydrogen combustion are: 

•  Mechanical impact 

o  EN 13463-1 provides consideration on condition under which single impacts 

between metal parts need not to be considered as potential ignition sources (e.g., 
impact velocity, energy, couple of materials impacted) 

•  Friction sparks are caused by hard objects coming into shearing contact with each other, 

such as metal striking metal, metal striking stone, or stone striking stone. Friction sparks are 
particles of burning material that have been sheared off as a result of contact. The particle 
initially is heated by the mechanical energy of friction and impact. 

•  Friction and galling 

o  Galling is a form of wear caused by adhesion between sliding surfaces. The 

combination of friction and galling generates heat 

•  Frictional Heating: Parts of a component or system can rub against each other with enough 
force and/or velocity to raise any one part to its ignition temperature at the given oxygen 
pressure and concentration. 

•  Metal fracture 

•  Tensile rupture 

o  Metal fracture or tensile rupture can produce spark or a loss of function 

•  Mechanical vibration 

o  Materials that are poor heat conductors such as plastics can reach their ignition 

temperatures when stressed or vibrated. 

o  Vibration may reduce gasket material resilience and cause a leak. 

•  Safety burst disk 

o  Sudden hydrogen releases into piping filled with air, after a safety burst disk 

ruptures, can be spontaneously ignited at pressures as low as about 2 MPa. The way 
in which the burst disk ruptures (non-instantaneous burst) is probably the most 
important factor for spontaneous ignition as it affects the hydrogen-air mixing. 
(Dryer et al., 2007).

F.2.3.3 

Ignition Due to Thermal Sources 

F.2.3.3.1  Auto-Ignition Temperature 

The standard auto-ignition temperature of hydrogen in air is above 510°C (Baratov et al., 1990). 
It is relatively high compared to hydrocarbons having long molecules. However, it can be 
lowered by catalytic surfaces. Objects at temperatures from 500°C (932°F) to 580°C (1076°F) 
can ignite hydrogen-air or hydrogen-oxygen mixtures at atmospheric pressure. Substantially 
cooler objects of about 320°C (608°F) can cause ignition under prolonged contact at less than 
atmospheric pressure (NASA, 1997). Hot air jet ignition temperature is 670°C (1238°F) [BRHS, 
2009]. 

F.2.3.3.2  Compression Heating 

To avoid the possible risk of fire or explosion, high-pressure shut-off valves should be designed 
to provide effective slow opening and closing. This requirement is applicable for oxygen 
systems –reference EASA AMC 25.869(c). 

A common example of compression heating, shown in Figure 76 in an oxygen system occurs 
when a valve (especially a fast opening ball or plug valve) is opened quickly and the gas stream 
compresses the oxygen downstream against an obstruction. A closed valve or regulator is an 
obvious obstruction, but often the obstruction is not obvious because it exists within the valve 
itself. For example, the obstruction may exist at a valve seat as it is being opened, at the outlet 
of a partially open regulator, or at another small orifice. In addition, the gas stream can be 
obstructed at the angle in an elbow fitting. For hydrogen lines, an ignition could occur only in 
the presence of oxidizing contaminants.

F.2.3.3.3  High Temperature Ignition 

Material and gas exposure to high temperature components that are not adequately insulated 
can be a source of ignition. 

F.2.3.3.4  Resonance Ignition (Repeated Shock Waves in a Flow System) 

Resonance: Acoustic oscillations within resonant cavities can cause a rapid rise in gas 
temperature.  For hydrogen a line, an ignition concern could occur only in the presence of 
oxidizing contaminants. 

  MECHANICAL/MATERIALS HAZARDS 

A hydrogen system can consist of structural members and will involve a multitude of different 
materials. Awareness of the unique properties of hydrogen is essential for the safe use of 
hydrogen. This section will concentrate on the mechanical/materials related hazards. 

F.3.1  Material Compatibility Hazards 

The selection of a suitable material for hydrogen applications requires consideration of the 
following as appropriate: 

F.3.1.1  Embrittlement 

Hydrogen can cause a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of metals. This 
effect is referred to as hydrogen embrittlement. 

Hydrogen embrittlement involves a large number of variables such as the temperature and 
pressure of the environment; the purity, concentration, and exposure time of the hydrogen; 
and the stress state, physical and mechanical properties, microstructure, surface conditions, 
and nature of the crack front of the material. A crack consists of two surfaces within a solid 
body, between which atomic bonds do not exist, and where the surfaces are bounded by their 
intersections with the surface of the body or by a line along which atomic bonds exist. The 
surfaces are called fracture surfaces or crack faces, and the line is called the crack front. 

Once absorbed, dissolved hydrogen may be present either as atomic or molecular hydrogen or 
in combined molecular form (e.g., methane). These individual hydrogen atoms within the metal 
gradually recombine to form hydrogen molecules, creating pressure from within the metal. The 
pressure causes cracks due to the intermolecular forces between two surfaces This pressure 
can increase to levels where the metal has reduced ductility and load-bearing capacity, cause 
cracking and catastrophic brittle failures at stresses below the yield stress of susceptible 
materials and the subsequent spills and leaks create hazards. There is a critical surface 
displacement at which the two surfaces no longer feel the force from each other, that is, a 
displacement between opposing surfaces that exceeds the effective range of the forces. 

190 

 
Figure 77. Hydrogen-Induced Cracks (HIC) 

Figure 78. H2 Blistering 

Sources of hydrogen causing embrittlement have been encountered in the making of steel, in 
processing parts, in welding, in storage or containment of hydrogen gas, and related to 
hydrogen as a contaminant in the environment that is often a by-product of general corrosion. 

F.3.1.1.1  Effect on Mechanical Properties 

The mechanical properties of metals are reduced in the presence of hydrogen. As an example 
of severe hydrogen embrittlement, the elongation at failure of 17-4PH precipitation hardened 
stainless steel was measured to drop from 17% to only 1.7% when smooth specimens were 
exposed to high-pressure hydrogen. 

The susceptibility of steel to hydrogen embrittlement increases as the pressure of the hydrogen 
environment increases. The susceptibility of an alloy to adverse hydrogen effects increases as 
the strength of the alloy increases. Embrittlement leading to an increased crack growth rate 
results in a decreased fatigue life. 

If exposed to hydrogen and cyclic stresses, a metal or alloy is almost certain to have a lower 
resistance to fatigue than if hydrogen were not present. 

191 

 
 
 
F.3.1.1.2  Embrittlement mitigation 

Proper material selection during fuel cell design will avoid the embrittlement phenomenon. In 
addition, effect of low leakages on surrounding aircraft systems and structure should be 
considered. As with any good design, the material selected must be adequate for the intended 
use. This is also applicable for material exposed to hydrogen. There has been a lot of 
evaluation, testing and analysis regarding material compatibility with hydrogen. Embrittlement 
on Aircraft systems and structures should not be a concern as long as there is no H2 
accumulation over an extended period of time. 

Designers should, in the absence of data, assume a substantial (up to fivefold) decrease in 
resistance to fatigue. Aluminum is one of the few metals known to show only minimal 
susceptibility to hydrogen. 

Most GH2 equipment is made of medium strength steel. Hydrogen embrittlement concerns are 
addressed through increased thickness, surface finish, welding techniques, and materials 
selection. 

Materials in contact with hydrogen gas shall comply with the metallic compatibility 
characteristics documented in ISO 11119. 

Another valuable source of information comes from Sandia National Laboratories which gathers 
existing materials data for inclusion in the Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of 
Materials. SAND2012-7321 Individual sections of this report may be updated or added 
periodically at this website:  http://www.sandia.gov/matlsTechRef. 

One should therefore take into consideration that: 

•  At room temperature, most elastomers are inert with respect to H2. 

•  At high pressure, steels (especially cold worked ferritic steels) can suffer from hydrogen 
embrittlement. Metals with a face-centered cubic structure, such as, austenitic stainless 
steels, aluminum alloys, copper, and copper alloys, generally are satisfactory for hydrogen 
service. Nickel, a face-centered cubic material, is an exception and generally should not use 
because it is subject to severe hydrogen embrittlement. Un-stabilized austenitic stainless 
steel (some of the 300 series) can revert to a martensitic structure when stressed above the 
yield stress at low temperature, reducing the ductility of the steel. 

•  At high temperatures, one should use austenitic steels (AISI 316 or 304) to avoid 

segregation of carbon at grain boundaries. 

•  At low temperatures materials should remain sufficiently ductile. Steels such as AISI 316L or 

304L, as well as aluminum and aluminum alloys could be used. 

Many types of elastomers are compatible with H2 gas at ambient temperature. For high 
pressure service caution must be observed if elastomers will be subject to rapidly changing 
pressures 

192 

 
F.3.1.2  Diffusion and Permeation 

Hydrogen is the smallest molecule and possesses a low viscosity as a fluid. It can penetrate and 
leak through materials and seals more readily that other gases including helium and nitrogen; 
consequently, the possibility of diffusion as a result of permeation or material porosity must be 
evaluated for a hydrogen system. 

Permeation refers to the property of a substance, gas, vapor, or liquid, i.e. a “permeate”, to 
penetrate through a solid. Permeation is not as a leakage a failure but can be a normal behavior 
of the material in presence of H2. 

Permeation is a process, driven by concentration gradient that has several steps: 

•  Absorption at the material interface in which the permeate is adsorbed at the surface of the 

solid, 

•  Diffusion in which the permeate moves through pores or molecular gaps within the solid, 

and 

•  Desorption, whereby the adsorbate leaves the solid. 

F.3.2  Failure of High-Pressure Gaseous Storage Systems 

A compressed gas can have significant potential energy.  Failure in high pressure gas storage 
systems can be the result of a passive component failure (i.e., tank, tubing, etc.) or an active 
component failure (i.e., valve, pressure relief device). Specific component hazard failures are 
discussed in the following sections.  Hydrogen storage systems should be qualified to survive 
damage resulting from shipping and handling (such as dropping). 

Critical failure of passive components, such as tanks and lines, would result in the 
leakage/rupture of the component.  Side effects of leakage/rupture of a component could be 
debris/shrapnel to the immediate area, release of flammable gas, and/or system in operation.  
Most passive components are screened by design and testing requirements both prior to 
installation and post installation into a system. 

Design, manufacture, integration and test of compressed gas systems must take safety into 
account; mitigation approaches are discussed in later sections 

F.3.3  Failure of Pressure Relief Devices 

Pressure relief devices (PRDs) play a critical role in the implementation of most high-pressure 
gas storage systems. In the event of an over-pressure situation induced by, for example, 
overfilling, exposure to excessive heat, or a liquid to gas phase change, the PRD will activate 
and allow the gas to escape to a safe location. The PRD should be set such that that it prevents 
catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel, irreversible damage, or degradation of the pressure 
vessel life cycle. 

193 

 
Two main failure modes of the PRD are feasible: 

•  Type 1 Failure: A PRD should activate but does not 

•  Type 2 Failure: A PRD activates when it should not 

A Type 1 failure has far more hazardous potential than a Type 2 failure because it results in a 
situation where the internal pressure within a vessel can exceed its MAWP and consequent 
leakage/rupture. 

The scenario leading to overpressure could be an external heat source (e.g. a fire, bleed lines, 
adjacent equipment, etc.) 

Current thermally activated PRDs are local heat detectors only. Hence, they activate when their 
immediate surroundings are heated, but cannot detect localized heat sources elsewhere in the 
middle of the container. They protect containers from large, distributed fires, but not highly 
localized fires. 

PRD´s are utilized on today´s civil aircraft, (e.g., for high pressure fire extinguisher containers), 
and the design and integration of such devices is a normal practice. In addition, the PRD´s are a 
failure mitigation means typically used where the probability of the failure itself and the 
probability of the loss of the mitigation means is extremely remote 

Type 2 failures typically result from improperly maintained equipment, improper selection or 
sizing, or compromised structural properties possibly due to the hydrogen environment.  (NREL 
2013) 

A type 2 failure is not detrimental to the fuel cell system but can be detrimental for an aircraft 
depending on the system integration. 

Since the PRDs and associated connections and tubes can be damaged by the exposure to 
water or ice, PRD vent systems should be designed to prevent the ingress of foreign material or 
accumulation of moisture in the system. Additionally, moisture in the vent line could potentially 
freeze under cold service conditions. 

Safety valves should be designed so the movable parts cannot stick or seize even with unequal 
heating or cooling. 

A rupture disk or relief valve shall be installed in every section of a line where liquid or cold gas 
can be trapped. 

Supplemental pressure-relief devices should be installed to protect against excessive pressures 
created by exposure to fire or other unexpected sources of external heat. 

F.3.4  Crashworthiness 

This requirement is that certain equipment will not detach from its mountings, or separate in a 
manner that presents a hazard during an emergency landing. It applies to equipment installed 

194 

 
in compartments and other areas of the aircraft where equipment detached during emergency 
landing could present a hazard to occupants, fuel systems or emergency evacuation equipment. 

The requirement for crashworthiness is applicable for a fuel cell system as for any other system 
and the specifics of the assessed system need to be considered along with the individual system 
architecture. 

In addition to a crash, consideration should be made for an emergency landing made within the 
operating limits of the aircraft.  This is in contrast to a crash, which is a maneuver that is out of 
control and typically results in the loss of the aircraft hull. 

In addition to the equipment no detaching criteria; an additional pass/fail criterion linked to the 
FC system should be “no H2 hazardous leak allowed”. 

In addition, current pressure vessel standard ISO 11119 requests gun fire test to prove that the 
pressure vessel will remain structurally intact (without explosion) after an impact. 

Regarding pressure vessels, it is recommended: 

•  To accept the ISO standard 11119 part 1 to 3 for the aviation qualification of high pressure 

vessels for oxygen and hydrogen. 

•  To consider the generation of ETSO requirements for high pressure vessels on board civil 

aircraft. 

•  To promote the application of the ISO standard in harmonization activities between ISO and 

DOT. 

  HAZARD DEPENDENT ON APPLICATION/IMPLEMENTATION 

For fuel cells operating on hydrogen fuel, consideration for hydrogen hazards must be included 
in the design.  Some example hydrogen mitigation hazards for systems of an aircraft are: 

•  Passenger and crew compartments and areas connected to them should be considered to 

contain nominal ignition sources. 

•  Single failures of hydrogen containing components shall not lead to uncontrolled leakages.  
If single failures result in hydrogen leakage, mitigation means shall be provided to prevent 
uncontrolled leakage (reference § 25.1309). 

•  Ventilation has to be provided where hydrogen leakage into any compartment is a 

possibility.  In general leaking hydrogen must be vented overboard unless it can be shown 
that no hazard exists by its discharge within the compartment in which it is installed. 

Figure 79 provides an order of magnitude of the hydrogen flow released from a pressure 
carrying component from a given diameter orifice. 

195 

 
Figure 79. Hydrogen Flow for A Given Diameter Orifice 

One can easily conclude that a gaseous 350 bar H2 pressure vessel or associated high pressure 
piping that leaks through a given diameter orifice will release within a few seconds a hazardous 
amount of H2 into its installation area. An applicant will have to demonstrate the effectiveness 
of the mitigation means to address the effect of such hazard or to demonstrate that such 
hazard is extremely improbable. 

Installation of high pressure components could be proposed into an occupied/pressurized area 
only if a mitigation mean is provided to cope with the above high leakage scenario.  Fuel cell 
systems must be designed to safely dissipate heat and exhaust products.  A system installed 
inside the pressurized volume can have the reaction products vented outside of the pressurized 
area.  A hydrogen based fuel cell product released inside the pressurized area of an aircraft 
would affect the heat and water content of the air which the aircraft design and environmental 
control systems would have to accommodate. Fuel cell systems which have the potential to 
leak CO, CO2 or other hazardous fuel by-products would have additional safety and ventilation 
requirements. One advantage of installing a fuel cell in an unpressured area is that it is easier to 
vent H2 leakage overboard, however the environment is harsher. 

  PHYSIOLOGICAL HAZARDS 

Personnel present during leaks, fires, or explosions of hydrogen systems can incur several types 
of injury. 

196 

 
 
•  Asphyxiation is a hazard when someone enters a region where hydrogen or a purge gas has 

displaced the air, diluting the oxygen below 19.5% by volume. 

•  Burns can result from direct contact with a hydrogen fire, thermal radiation from a 

hydrogen fire, or contact with a surface that has been heated by a hydrogen fire.  Reference 
FAR 25.1360. 

•  Frostbite (freezing, cryogenic burn) can result from contact with a cold fluid or a cold 

surface. 

•  Blast (overpressure) can result from a detonation, deflagration or from the unconfined 

expansion of a compressed gas. 

•  Fragments may be created when a hydrogen explosion acts on its container or other items 
in close proximity. These fragments can result in injury or death to personnel, and damage 
or destruction of equipment. 

•  Noxious gases generated in case of fire. 

Toxicity is not an issue with hydrogen or its combustion product, water. 

  OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE HAZARDS 

Dedicated procedures must be developed to prevent against specific hydrogen hazards. As an 
example, unless the hydrogen storage tanks will be removed, always leave a small amount of 
pressure in the tanks so that the internal pressure is a few psi above atmospheric pressure. Any 
time tank pressure falls below atmospheric, it is possible for air to enter, and the tank must be 
to purge with nitrogen before refilling with hydrogen. In addition, a means needs to be 
provided to ground the Fill Station, during Refueling, prior to fill nozzle connection. Another 
alternative is to have a pressure vessel refueling procedure outside of the airplane. 

Maintenance procedures should also be developed according to §§ 25.1529 and 25.1729 to 
ensure proper maintenance for safe continued operation of the FCS. 

For instance, in these maintenance procedures could be included to periodically check all 
connections in the hydrogen fuel system for leaks. Leak checks should also be conducted after 
repair or replacement of any fuel system lines or valves. 

Anyone who will operate or maintain hydrogen-fueled system should receive hydrogen safety 
training. At a minimum, this training should cover the characteristics of hydrogen, operation of 
onboard safety systems, hydrogen fueling operations, and actions to take in an emergency. 

In addition to specific hydrogen hazards, fuel cells can induce well-known hazards such as: 

•  Electric shock, 

o  When working -with voltage systems, always ensure that proper safety procedures 

are followed. 

197 

 
•  Hot temperature, 

o  Hot temperature of stack and balance of plant components might dictate to let the 

temperature cool down before maintenance actions. 

Even though these hazards are well known, the Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness 
should be checked to address these. 

Relevant marking, labelling and a set of maintenance instruction are needed to ensure safe 
maintenance. 

  HYDROGEN FIRE EXTINGUISHING 

A hydrogen fire should not be extinguished with water or chemicals. Static electricity generated 
across the leak orifice, or an adjacent hot surface, could explosively reignite the leaking 
hydrogen. The best way to deal with a hydrogen fire is to shut off the flow of hydrogen gas by 
closing supply valves, which will extinguish the flame. Essentially the shut-off of hydrogen is the 
only meaningful way to stop a hydrogen fire in flight because if the supply of hydrogen cannot 
be stopped the fire will always reignite on hot surfaces. 

For firefighting on ground: 

If a small flame must be extinguished in order to gain access to a hydrogen supply valve, a dry-
powder extinguisher is recommended. Normal procedures can be used to extinguish secondary 
fires, if any, ignited by the burning hydrogen. 

The flow of hydrogen through a leaking PRD/TRD cannot be stopped. The best approach in this 
situation is to let the fire burn until all of the hydrogen has been consumed. (US department of 
Transportation) 

  CRYOGENIC HYDROGEN (LIQUID OR CRYO-COMPRESSED) HAZARDS 

An essential safety concern of liquid hydrogen’s low temperature is that, with the exception of 
helium, all gases exposed to such cryogenic temperatures will change their state to liquid form 
or even to solid form depending on the individual physical properties of the gas. Leaks of air or 
other gases exposed with liquid hydrogen can plug pipes and orifices and jam valves. (ISO/TR 
15916:2004). 

Oxygen enrichment can increase the flammability and even lead to the formation of shock-
sensitive compounds. Oxygen particulate in cryogenic hydrogen gas may even detonate. 

The volume of liquid hydrogen expands significantly with the addition of heat. The coefficient of 
thermal expansion at NBP (normal boiling point at absolute pressure of 101.325kPa) is 23 times 
that of water at ambient conditions (ISO/TR 15916:2004). The significance for safety arises 
when cryogenic storage vessels have insufficient ullage space to accommodate expansion of the 

198 

 
liquid. This can lead to an over-pressurization of the vessel or penetration of the liquid 
hydrogen into transfer and vent lines. 

A considerable increase in volume is associated with the phase change of liquid to gaseous 
hydrogen, and yet another volume increase occurs for gaseous hydrogen that is allowed to 
warm from the NBP to NTP (Normal Temperature and Pressure). The ratio of the final volume 
to the initial volume for the phase change from liquid to gaseous hydrogen and expansion of 
heated gas is 847 (ISO/TR 15916:2004). This total volume increase can result in a final pressure 
of 177 MPa (starting with an initial pressure of 0.101 MPa) if the gaseous hydrogen is in a 
closed vessel. Pressure relief devices should be installed as a safety measure in any volume in 
which liquid hydrogen or cold gaseous hydrogen could be trapped, to prevent overpressure 
from expansion of the liquid hydrogen or cold gaseous hydrogen. 

In addition, 

•  Hydrogen liquid-to-gas transition is cold and can generate burns. 

•  Material selection should be compatible to cryogenic temperature. 

•  Cryogenic component and lines need to have adequate insulation to prevent condensation 

of liquid air on lines and overheating of cryogenic liquid. 

Refer to annex B of ANSI/AIAA G-095-2004 for insulation selection guidelines 

  NON-HYDROGEN FUEL AND OXYGEN HAZARDS 

F.9.1  Hydrocarbon Fuel Hazards 

F.9.2  Oxygen 

Oxygen hazards are addressed already in the regulation and existing guidance materials do 
exist, so it is not the intent of this document to develop the oxygen risks.  It should be noted 
however that currently installed oxygen systems provide a safety benefit to the aircraft in the 
form of providing oxygen in the event a smoke/fire event.  This safety benefit is considered 
when evaluating the installation requirements for certification.  Any installation of a pressurized 
oxygen system should consider a complete risk/benefit analysis to ensure adequate safety 
levels are maintained.  Some fuel cell installations will dictate to have in the same vicinity 
oxygen, hydrogen, and electrical power and possibly a flammable coolant. This unique 
environment needs to be reevaluated 

Fuel cell equipment includes the use of pressurized vessels, regulators, valves, tubing and 
fittings stack and electrical harnesses made of metals and nonmetals. All of these materials are 
combustible in a 100% pressurized oxygen atmosphere. 

From a safety aspect, fuel cells using air instead of pressurized oxygen substantially reduce the 
risk associated with operation in an oxygen environment. 

199 

 
SAE document AIR825/13, Guide for Evaluating Combustion Hazards in Aircraft Oxygen 
Systems, may be used as a guideline for how to conduct an oxygen systems hazard analysis. 
Confer also to the FAA policy statement PS-ANM-25.1441-01, Mitigating Fire Hazards in 
Gaseous Oxygen systems, dated 12/9/14. 

  ELECTRICAL HAZARDS 

A FCS should have protections against the following hazard conditions associated with an 
electrical power generating system to maintain equivalent level of safety with traditional 
methods of supplying electricity: 

•  Uncontrolled over voltage 

•  Uncontrolled under voltage 

•  Uncontrolled over frequency 

•  Uncontrolled under frequency 

•  Voltage instability 

•  High voltage DC 

•  Frequency instability 

•  Voltage distortion 

•  High ripple 

•  Electromagnetic interference 

•  Unprotected feeder faulty 

This is usually addressed by qualification against RTCA DO160 standard and aircraft power 
quality requirements and by complying with CFR/CS §q 25.1431.  Other applicable references 
are MIL-STD-704 and ISO 1540.

 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REGULATORY STANDARDS AND 

ADVISORY MATERIAL 

  INTRODUCTION 

After developing the information on various types of fuel cell technologies, their possible 
aircraft applications and potential hazards, and the review of existing part 25 regulatory 
requirements, it was decided to develop one new part 25 regulation.  The proposed regulation 
addresses the main concerns the Committee identified as necessary to cope with the 
installation of a fuel cell system (FCS) on board an aircraft. This proposed regulation is referred 
to as the fuel cell system safety baseline regulation and it is located in section G.4.1.  Section 
G.4.2. discusses the background of this proposed regulation along with references to the 
hazards as described in Appendix F and current regulations that address similar issues. 

The committee also identified regulations currently existing in the CFR / CS 25 that would need 
revising in order to support the certification of FCSs. These are located in Table 19 in section 
G.5.  Furthermore, the Committee also collected those regulations currently in CFR / CS 25 that 
are seen as applicable, but do not need revising. These are included in this report, because 
some hazards were identified to be covered by those regulations. They are located in Table 20 
in section G.6.  The committee also identified operational requirements contained in CFR parts 
43, 91, 121, 125, and 129 that are applicable to fuel cell systems.  These are located in Table 21 
in section G.8. 

As discussed in the main body of this report, the committee did not develop recommendations 
for ESDs other than fuel cells.  However, the committee did develop a more performance based 
regulation that could be used as the basis for replacing the exiting § 25.1353(b) (FAA) / 
25.1353(c) (EASA).  The current § 25.1353(b) / 25.1353(c) addresses storage batteries.  
However, its requirements are not sufficient to address all of the safety concerns attributed to 
Lithium-based batteries.  This has led to the issuance of special conditions.  The recommended 
replacement for § 25.1353(b) / 25.1353(c), if adopted, would negate the need to issue special 
conditions for lithium-based batteries as well as other types of ESDs, including fuel cells.  The 
proposed regulation is located in section G.5.1. 

Although the Committee did not thoroughly go through the CFR / CS parts 23, 27, and 29 
airworthiness standards, the same concerns would apply with the typical differences between 
the different product types. The Committee therefore recommends if a rulemaking committee 
is created, this group will amend the different airworthiness standards based on the 
conclusions presented in this report. 

Recommendations for material that should be included in an advisory circular(s) is included in 
section G.7 of this Appendix. 

201 

 
  DISCUSSION 

For the purposes of the regulation a fuel cell system is defined as: Those units and components 
using an electrochemical conversion process to produce electricity from a fuel and an oxidant.  
This includes reactants and reaction products, steam reformers, supply/exhaust devices, 
enclosures, fuel cell stacks, electric power output devices, cooling or/and heating devices, and a 
centralized control and monitoring subsystem. 

The approach taken by the Committee was as follows. The Committee first needed to have the 
technical details of the FCS as expected to be installed in aircraft. The fuel cell types identified 
to have this potential are the PEM and SOFC. 

The next step was to identify the hazards of such installations. After the identification of the 
hazards, the Committee compared the identified risks with the current CFR / CS 25 regulations. 
Appendix F, identifies which hazards in particular need attention, when installed in an aircraft. 
Those were identified as not yet properly addressed in the current airworthiness codes. 

In order to help the discussions on the regulations, a few examples for the use of FCS are 
described in Appendix E. With the examples, applicable regulations were identified as a starting 
point. These examples are not intended to be complete, nor to be acceptable in an actual 
certification project. 

Appendices B and C describes different types of fuel cells (FC), using different technologies. 
From the different types of FCs described, PEM and Solid Oxide fuel cells are the most feasible 
types for use in commercial aviation in the near future. Therefore, the regulatory standards and 
advisory material discussed are based on these two FC types. If another type of FC is 
introduced, the particular technical differences with the PEM and Solid Oxide FCs should be 
identified and considered again. 

Solid Oxide and PEM FCs are part of the example applications presented in Appendix E. These 
example applications were used to find the applicable regulations and to identify whether the 
current regulations are applicable as they are, or need modification. This exercise also revealed 
design, installation, and safety concerns that are not addressed by the current 14 CFR Part 25 or 
CS25. The examples are “galley power”, “stand-alone power” (Medevac), “auxiliary power”, 
“emergency power”, and “UAS”. The considerations regarding the applicable airworthiness 
regulations are collected in Tables 12, 14, and 15 in Appendix E. 

Appendix F identifies the different hazards of fuel cell installations. The main conclusion is that 
the hydrogen is giving some hazards that might not be new in itself, but are not currently well 
addressed in the airworthiness requirements.  Hydrogen is more common in “On ground 
solutions”, which drove the developing of standards covering different aspects of hydrogen and 
fuel cells. One important consideration is the fire risks associated with the use of hydrogen. 
Oxygen is currently in use on board aircraft; hence dedicated requirement exists in case the fuel 
cell installation encompasses oxygen bottles, even though most systems will probably use cabin 
or external air to supply the needed oxygen to the fuel cell.

  REGULATORY STANDARDS AND ADVISORY MATERIAL 

G.3.1  Regulatory Standards 

Sections G.4 and G.5 contain recommendations for new and revised CFR/CS 25 regulatory 
standards that are based on the identified hazards discussed in Appendix F. 

Section G.6 identifies current CFR/CS part 25 regulations applicable to fuel cell systems that do 
not require revision. 

Section G.8 Identifies maintenance and operational regulations contained in CFR parts 43, 91, 
121, 125, and 129 that are applicable to fuel cells. 

G.3.2  Advisory Material 

Section G.7 discusses the development of Advisory Material regarding fuel cell systems.  It 
discusses what should be included in an advisory circular to support compliance to any new and 
revised regulations 

  NEW CFR/CS 25 REGULATIONS 

Fuel cell systems can introduce unique hazards that are not currently, or fully, addressed by the 
current set of CFR/CS 25 regulatory standards.  Therefore, the ESD ARC recommends that a new 
fuel cell system safety baseline regulation be developed to address these hazards. Section G.4.1 
identifies the requirements, or type of requirement, that should be included in the regulation.  
Rationale that aligns each subparagraph of the baseline regulation to specific fuel cell hazard 
categories is given in section G.4.2. 

The classification of failure conditions used in the baseline regulation is given in Table 17.  
These failure conditions are identical to those proposed by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory 
Committee for the draft (Arsenal) version of AC 25.1309-1B, dated June 10, 2002. 

203 

 
Table 17. Classification of Failure Condition 

Term 

Explanation 

Hazardous 

Failure conditions that would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of 
the flight crew to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there 
would be, for example: 

A large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; 

Physical distress or excessive workload such that the flight crew cannot be relied 
upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or 

Serious or fatal injuries to a relatively small number of persons other than the 
flight crew. 

Catastrophic 

Failure conditions that would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of 
the airplane.  (NOTE:  A catastrophic failure condition was defined differently in 
previous versions of § 25.1309 and in accompanying advisory material as “a failure 
condition that would prevent continued safe flight and landing.”)

25.XXX Fuel Cell System Safety 

a)  For the purposes of this chapter, a fuel cell system is defined as: Those units and 

components using an electrochemical conversion process to produce electricity from 
a fuel and an oxidant. This includes reactants and reaction products, steam 
reformers, supply and exhaust devices, enclosures, fuel cell stacks, electric power

type design must also include inspection and test procedures, intervals between 
repetitive inspections and tests, and mandatory replacement times for those design

G.4.2  Background on the Proposal of the New Regulation 25.XXX Hydrogen Fuel Cell System 
Safety: Relation of Regulatory Standards to Safety Concerns 

This section describes the relationship between the proposed baseline regulation paragraphs 
and the relevant safety issues discussion in Appendix F of this report. 

(a) “Definition of Fuel Cell System” 

The proposed definition of fuel cell system contained in (a) reflects, with some variation, the 
one used by the industry. 

(b) “The design and installation of a Fuel Cell System must prevent catastrophic explosion due 
to ignition of fuel or vapors.” 

A fuel cell system typically introduces hazards that are not yet commonly known in aviation, 
mostly to deal with the used reactants (e.g., hydrogen and oxygen). Hence the reference to 
ignition of fuel vapors. The wording chosen here is what we think is adequate according to 
current rulemaking practices. 

The reason to introduce this specific paragraph is linked to the hazards as identified in sections 
F2.1, F2.2, F3.3, F3.4, F4, F5, F9.2, F2.3.1.1, F2.3.1.2, and F2.3.3 of Appendix F. Currently we 
know paragraphs in CFR/CS 25 that relate to this proposed paragraph.  These are identified as 
§§ 25.863, 25.981, 25.1183, 25.1185, 25.1189(a). 

(c) “To comply with paragraph (b), catastrophic explosion due to ignition of fuel or vapors 
must be extremely improbable and not result from a single failure, taking into account all 
factors that could cause a catastrophic explosion, including….” 

Paragraph (c) provides a number of factors that must be considered when demonstrating that a 
catastrophic explosion due to ignition of fuel or vapors is extremely improbable. The list is not 
meant to be exhaustive and other factors may need to be addressed.  This will depend on the 
specific design characteristics of the fuel cell system at hand. 

1.  Emission of explosive or toxic gases. The background can be found in the identified 
hazards per sections F2.2.9, F2.2.10, F2.2.11, F2.2.12, F2.2.13, F3.1.1, F3.2, F4 of 

206 

 
Appendix F. Failure modes of the FCS can lead to emission of explosive or toxic gases, 
see sections C.4.11, C.5.10, and C.7.9. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.1441, 
25.1450, 25.863, 25.963, 25.965, 25.1183, 25.1185(c), 25.1453, 25.1707, 25.1723, 
25.1723 are also related to this item. 

2.  Minimum ignition energy. The background per hazard sections F2, F9, F2.3.1 of 

Appendix F. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.981, 25.1183, 25.1185, and 
25.1723 are also related to this item. 

3.  Static electricity. The background can be found per hazard sections F10, F4, F2.3.1of 

Appendix F The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.899, 25.1715 are also related to this 
item. 

4.  Electrical faults. The background can be found per hazard sections F10, F4, F2.3.1of 

Appendix F. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.863(b)(3), CS 25.1353(e), 25.1723 
are also related to this item. 

5.  Over pressurization of reactant storage vessels. The background can be found per 

hazard section F8.1 of Appendix F. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.601, 25.603 
are also related to this item. 

6.  Mechanical ignition sources. The background can be found per hazard section F2.3.2  in 

Appendix F. Depending on the technology used, the FC Stack can be sensitive to 
mechanical damage and release flammable/explosive gases as a result, for instance 
SOFC, see section C.7.9. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.863, and 25. 981are 
also related to this item. 

7.  Electromagnetic waves. The background can be found per hazard section F2.3.1.9, 
F2.3.1.10 of Appendix F. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25. 981 (a), 25.1435, 
25.1703, and 25.1707 are also related to this item. 

8.  Lightning strikes. The background can be found per hazards sections F2, F2.3.1.7of 

Appendix F. The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.581, 25.954, 25. 981, and 25.1316 
are also related to this item. 

9.  Fire. The background can be found per hazards sections F2.2.1, F9.2, F4 of Appendix F. 
The current CFR/CS 25 regulations §§ 25.853, 25.863, 25.865, 25.867, and 25.869 are 
also related to this item. 

10. Heat emission. The background can be found per hazards due to fire and high operating 
temperatures for specific types of FCS. The current CFR/CS §§ 25.855(g), 25.863, 25.867. 

(d) “To comply with (c)(8) the following must be taken into account . . .” 

This proposed regulation is based on the current § 25.954 “Fuel System Lightning Protection”.  
Like a fuel system for engines, the fuel cell system is vulnerable for the effects of a lightning 
strike. This can be due to direct effects, but also to indirect effects like induced or conducted 
transients. The current § 25.954 only addresses this for the fuel system for power plants 
(engines.) 

207 

 
The current 25.1316 “Electrical and electronic system lightning protection” and 25.1317 “HIRF 
protection” are generally valid, so also for the new fuel cell systems. 

Background for inclusion can be found in the hazards sections F3.1.1, F4, F10.1, and F11 of 
Appendix F. Current CFR/CS 25 regulations related to this are §§ 25.581, 25.899, 25.954, 25. 
981, 25.1316 and 25.1317. 

(e) “Hydrogen leakage detection must be installed in any area of the airplane where 
hydrogen may accumulate and create a hazardous condition” 

Hydrogen will not be detected by humans as it does not smell, nor does it have a color. In areas 
where hydrogen could accumulate and create a catastrophic explosion, means of detection are 
needed. For more information see section F2.2.4, F2.2.6, F2.2.9of Appendix F. 

(f) Fuel cell system installation must not damage surrounding structure of adjacent systems, 
equipment, or electrical wiring from corrosive fluids or gases that may escape in such a way as 
to cause a hazardous condition. Like other ESD, the FCS uses different fluids and / or gases that, 
when escaping from the system, may cause damage and consequential failures of surrounding 
structural elements, equipment or EWIS components. The same type of regulation is currently 
used for specific types of batteries. For more information see section F3, F4 and F.6 of Appendix 
F. Current CFR/CS 25 regulations related to this new regulation are §§ 25.831, 25.1353, 
25.1529, and 25.1541. 

(g) “The fuel cell system must have a failure sensing and warning system to alert the 
flightcrew if its failure affects safe operation of the airplane.” 

Some of the failure cases of the fuel cell system can have an adverse effect on the safe 
operation of the aircraft. These failure cases can be related to the function the fuel cell system 
contributes to, or failures related to the fuel cell system, own functioning. Next to this, failures 
of the fuel cell system can also affect other systems or structures in its environment influencing 
safe operation. All these cases should be analyzed to determine if the flight crew should be 
alerted. The warning should be in accordance with CFR/CS § 25.1322. 

(h) “The design and installation of the reactant supply must prevent hazardous conditions 
due to improper handling by crew members, maintenance, passengers, or servicing 
personnel.” 

This regulation is in line with the current practices in CFR/CS 25. It intends to address hazards 
like burns, freezes, etc. In the case of the fuel cell system, it not only addresses those parts of 
the system permanently installed in the aircraft, but also parts that are removable. For 
instance, when an empty reactant vessel is exchanged for a full one, or is brought on board in 
some kind of container that is attached to the piping of the fuel cell system. This regulation is in 
accordance with similar regulations regarding protection of crew members, maintenance, 
passengers, or servicing personnel for other identified hazards (i.e. electrical shock.) Reference 
CFR/CS § 25.1360. 

208 

 
(i) “The fuel cell system must be designed to prevent hazardous hydrogen permeation and 
embrittlement of aircraft materials and structure, or otherwise to not have an adverse effect 
on the strength of materials or the flammability properties of materials.” 

Hydrogen is highly diffuse and can penetrate many materials. This can lead to changes in the 
characteristics of the material it has entered. Examples are flammability characteristics and 
structural integrity of materials. The latter needs consideration in combination with the 
possible permeation in primary or secondary structural elements of the aircraft. See section 
F3.1.1 of Appendix F.  Current regulations CFR/CS §§ 25.571, 25.601, and 25.603 support this 
issue. 

(j) “Means must be available for controlling or extinguishing a fire, such as stopping flow of 
fluids, gasses, or vapors, shutting down equipment, fire containment, or use of extinguishing 
agents.” 

Next to the risks of explosion, the risk of fire needs to be addressed as well. Hydrogen fire is 
barely visible. A Hydrogen fire does not radiate a lot of heat. This makes a detection difficult, 
but necessary. The temperature is high; therefore, a Hydrogen fire can easily combust other 
materials in its reach. The means to detect and extinguish a Hydrogen fire can be different for 
several FCS, its function and location in the airframe. 

Apart from the Hydrogen, the fuel cell system itself can cause a fire. I.e. if the fuel cell operates 
at high temperature. Other risks should be analyzed and measures taken accordingly. As 
example, such a risk could be the due to the use of a reformer to get Hydrogen from jet fuel. If 
the FCS uses a reformer, it is expected that the fuel used by the FCS will be the jet fuel already 
in use for the propulsion system and CFR/CS § 25.1181 should be considered. 

However, most of the fuel cell system does not need to comply with CFR/CS § 25.1181 and 
therefore will need to be installed in a zone where means to protect the airplane from the 
hazardous effects of fire may be required. These means may differ from the fire protection 
means for designated fire zones as currently defined within the CS and FAR regulation. 

See for instance F6, F5, F9, F2.3.2, F2.3.3, F2.3.3.1 of Appendix F. 

(k) “To protect fuel cell system design features that prevent catastrophic failures caused by all 
probable causes, the type design must include critical design configuration control limitations 
(CDCCLs)….” 

This requirement is similar § 25.981 for fuel tanks (reference). For a FCS, the need for CDCCL or 
other airworthiness limitations should be analyzed. 

(l) “The effect of fuel cell system operation on the cabin air must be assessed in normal 
operation and failure cases in order to show compliance to CS/CFR § 25.831 (a)(b)(c).” 

Oxygen is available in normal air. Therefore, it is not necessary for a fuel cell system to include 
dedicated O2 storage when used as one of the reactants. In case the O2 is taken from the air 

209 

 
inside the aircraft, a thorough analysis should first be made that the required amounts by the 
FCS allow enough oxygen in the air for crew members and passengers. 

Hydrogen will not be detected by humans as it does not smell, nor does it have a color. In 
certain amounts, it can be harmful to humans. The explosion risk should be considered when 
Hydrogen when the possibility exists to accumulate Hydrogen in certain areas. 

The current CFR/CS 25 regulation that are supporting this is § 25.831. 

(m) “Storage or disposal of by-products, such as water and oxygen depleted air, must not 
introduce hazardous conditions.” 

In addition to electrical energy, a FCS produces some other products as well. For instance, 
water, heat, and oxygen depleted air. If fossil fuels are used as the original source of hydrogen 
there will be more by-products, such as carbon dioxide. The disposal or storage of these by-
products, must not create new hazards and they should be properly addressed. 

Current applicable regulations include CFR/CS §§ 25.831 and 25.1455. 

(n) “Hydrogen pressure tanks, and lines between tanks and the shutoff means must be— 

1) Protected from unsafe temperatures; and 

2) Located where the probability and hazards of rupture in a crash landing are 
minimized.” 

The current regulations address the protection of oxygen equipment. Similarly, the hydrogen 
equipment needs protection as well. This needs to be addressed by a new regulation similar to 
CFR/CS § 25.1453 or a changed CFR/CS §25.1453 that next to oxygen also addresses hydrogen 
(or in the ideal case, it is made more general, and design details are provided in the guidance 
material.) The guidance material can point out to existing standards for such equipment. 
References to such standards can be found in Appendix D, where type III and IV vessels are 
identified as suitable for use on aircraft. However, this list might not be complete. 

The current regulation related to crash landing loads is CFR/CS §§ 25.561, 25.562, and 25.563. 

(o) “Each fuel cell system fuel line within the fuselage must be designed and installed to allow 
a reasonable degree of deformation and stretching without leakage where its leakage could 
introduce a hazard.” 

This requirement mirrors the existing regulations for fuel and main power cables, CFR/CS §§ 
25.993(f) and 25.1703(c). The idea is that the fuselage can be damaged with partial separation 
or other structural damage without the hydrogen lines breaking apart.  Allowing for a certain 
amount of stretching will help to minimize the probability of a hydrogen-fed fire and 
subsequent explosion inside the fuselage.  As it is used in this recommendation, a “reasonable 
degree of deformation and stretching” should be about 10% of the length of the hydrogen line. 

210 

 
  REVISIONS TO EXISTING REGULATORY STANDARDS 

With a few exceptions for most of the proposed regulations in this section the changes will be 
minor wording revisions. Most proposed changes consist of adding references or FCS related 
terminology or technical specificities. The exceptions are the recommendation for a 
performance based requirement (section G.5.1) to replace the existing CFR/CS § 25.1353(b) and 
a new paragraph to CFR/CS § 25.1707 (section G.5.2). 

G.5.1  Performance Based Requirement Applicable to All Energy Storage Devices 

Electrical energy supply devices are continually changing to meet the needs of the More Electric 
Aircraft.  Aircraft have used Lead Acid and Ni Cd batteries for years. These battery chemistries 
have been very reliable with known safety issues and mitigation techniques.  Currently, the 
regulatory requirements for batteries are covered under 14 CFR § 25.1353(b)/ EASA CS  
§ 25.1353(c).  While the aerospace industry has a long history of using both primary and 
secondary batteries, it, like many industries, is moving to batteries with more energy dense 
electrolytes to reduce the size and weight of the battery system. There has been a great deal of 
work in standard organizations (e.g., RTCA, SAE, IEEE) to provide guidelines for the safe design, 
installation and operation of Lithium batteries.  However, the current regulatory requirements 
contained in CFR § 25.1353(b)/CS § 25.1353(c) do not adequately address the unique safety 
issues associated with lithium based batteries.  Therefore, the FAA and other aviation 
airworthiness authorities have issued Special Conditions to address the unique hazards of these 
batteries.  The special conditions have been issued for both secondary or primary batteries; 
rechargeable and non-rechargeable. 

Batteries and capacitors provide short term power storage on the aircraft and it is well 
understood on how to integrate them into a transport aircraft. There are many well established 
aerospace committees working to further refine the technical requirements for batteries and 
capacitors.  The Committee felt hydrogen fuel cells would present the biggest challenge for 
integration and certification in an aircraft.  Therefore, the Committee did not investigate these 
types of energy storage devices and instead concentrated on the design, installation, operation 
and safety issues associated with hydrogen fuel cells. 

However, the Committee did develop a performance based requirement that is applicable to 
energy storage devices in general.  If adopted, it could be applied to fuels cells, super 
capacitors, storage batteries of differing chemistries including those that are lithium based, and 
other types of energy supply devices.  Adopting this recommendation would negate the need to 
continually develop and issue special conditions and also the need to revise it every time new 
ESD technologies are introduced in the aircraft. 

14 CFR § 25.1353(b) / EASA CS 25.1353(c) (in lieu of the existing standard) 

a)  An energy supply/storage device, ESD, means any system installed on the airplane for 
the purposes of energy supply as required by systems or functions on the aircraft. 

211 

 
The ESD includes functions of energy storage, energy generation or discharging 
energy, refilling or recharging, and or jettisoning. 

b)  For the purposes of this rule, ‘energy’ means any type of energy for the functioning 
of, or coming from the ESD, including, for example, fuels of any kind or electric 
current. 

c)  The characteristics of the ESD, including failure modes, must be identified. 

d)  Failure of the ESD must not contribute to, or cause, a catastrophic effect on the 

airplane unless shown to be extremely improbably and not resulting from a single 
failure, or a hazardous effect on the airplane unless shown extremely remote. 

e) 

In normal operation or foreseeable malfunction of the ESD, no explosive, toxic, or 
corrosive gases or fluids: 

1)  May accumulate in hazardous quantities 

2)  May damage structures or adjacent essential equipment or systems 

3)  May endanger passengers or crew 

f)  Hazardous effects on structures or essential equipment or systems caused by the 
maximum amount of heat that can be generated during normal operation or 
probable malfunctions must be prevented. 

g)  The ESD as described in a), b) and c) must: 

1)  Maintain safe operating temperatures, pressures, or any other identified 

parameter, during normal operation (including storage, generation/discharging, 
refilling/recharging and / or jettisoning) 

2)  Provide, as necessary, means of protection, or controlling the ESD to prevent 
hazardous conditions during normal operation or probable malfunction. The 
flightcrew should be able to monitor, receive warnings, and control as 
appropriate. 

h)  The design and installation of the ESD systems must minimize Likely errors during 

ground handling of the airplane, the ESD, or its components, to prevent a hazardous 
event. 

i) 

Instructions for continued airworthiness as required by §§ 25.1529 and 25.1729, 
must contain proper procedures including instructions on preventing the occurrence 
of any hazard to the ESD system, airplane, or to persons during refilling or recharging, 
and safe storage and exchange procedures of the ESD or its components if such a 
function / possibility is provided.

  ADVISORY MATERIAL FOR FUEL CELL SYSTEMS AND OTHER ESD 

The tables in sections G.5.2 and G.6 indicate the Advisory Material that is currently available in 
relation to the identified applicable regulations. In accordance with the decision on revising the 
regulation, the corresponding advisory material should be updated accordingly. 

The proposed new regulation, § 25.XXX Fuel Cell System Safety, clearly needs accompanying 
guidance material.  Section G.4.2 gives a short overview what could be discussed in an AC, as 
this indicates the background and hazards that are addressed by the proposed regulation. In 
addition, the tables in Sections G.5.2 and G.6 in the column addresses which hazard could be 
used in the development of advisory material. 

The guidance material should also reference those standards that help towards a safe design of 
the FCS or its individual components. For instance, the standards for hydrogen vessels as listed 
in section D.5.1. The SAE and EUROCAE have dedicated working groups for FCS in aviation. The 
documents produced by these groups should be acceptable for compliance finding as well and 
as such be discussed in the developed advisory material. 

The introduction of a performance based regulation to replace the existing prescriptive 
regulation on storage batteries, needs the development of advisory material.  Parts of the 
current CFR § 25.1353(b)/CS 25.1353(c) that prescribe how the different battery types should 
be installed feed into such advisory material. 

Currently most aviation authorities use special conditions for rechargeable and non-
rechargeable Li battery and battery systems. These are prescriptive of nature, and the very 
Lithium battery specific elements in these special conditions should be incorporated in the 
advisory material. The means of compliance that is published with these special conditions 
should also feed in the to be developed advisory material. 

The proposed revision to CFR § 25.1353(b)/CS 25.1353(c) is written to help streamline future 
certification of new ESD systems. As stated previously, the Committee has focused on hydrogen 
fuel cell systems.  However, advisory material for other ESDs should be based on the works of 
the various standard’s committee that are investigating these ESDs.

  STANDARD TERMINOLOGY 

Auto-Ignition Temperature:  The lowest temperature at which a substance will ignite without 
the presence of an addition ignition source such as a flame or spark. 

Balance of Plant:  The assembly of equipment used in the control of the reactants supporting 
the operation of the fuel cell stack. The equipment may consist of valves, sensors, pumps, 
compressors, humidification devices and water. 

Combustion:  A chemical reaction accompanied by the evolution of light and heat. 

Common Mode Failure:  The result of a failure event which, because of dependencies, causes 
multiple failures within a system, resulting in the system failing to perform its intended 
function. 

Compartment:  A space that is enclosed (by barriers) except for openings necessary for 
interconnection, controls, fuel supply and ventilation. 

Control Failure:  A failure in the controls in the fuel cell system so that it no longer operates 
correctly. Built-in-test and fail-safe measures need to be provided for this scenario. 

Deflagration:  A flame moving through a flammable mixture as a subsonic velocity, with respect 
to the unburned mixture. 

Designated Fire Zone:  A region in the aircraft which is designed to cope with a fire likely to 
occur (e.g., by means of fire resistant/proof materials and fire detection). 

Detonation:  An exothermic chemical reaction coupled to a shock wave that propagates 
through a detonable mixture. The velocity of the shock wave is supersonic with respect to the 
unburned gases. After initiation, the thermal energy of the reaction sustains the shock wave, 
and the shock wave compresses the unreacted material to sustain the reaction. 

245 

 
Double Barrier:  A system of two independent barriers, each of which is capable of acting as the 
sole partition between energized and accessible parts in the event of failure of the other 
partition. 

Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS):  EWIS, as used in this report, is defined by 
CFR/CS § 25.1701. 

Enclosure:  Physical envelope that partially or completely surrounds and belongs to the fuel cell 
system or subsystem.  It may be necessary for installation, interconnection, controls, safety, 
fuel supply and ventilation.  It can be used as a barrier to isolate the fuel cell from the 
compartment. 

Exhaust:  Fluids and gases leaving the fuel cell system during normal operation through the 
exhaust. 

Exhaust Conditioning:  The conditioning of exhaust products, such as the collection of fluids or 
dehumidification of gases. 

Explosion:  The rapid equilibration of pressure between the system and the surroundings. The 
pressure of the gas may be dissipated as a shock wave. Explosions may occur through 
mechanical failure of vessels containing high-pressure fluids or through rapid chemical 
reactions producing large volumes of gases. 

External Hydrogen Leakage:  The following leakage levels are defined in relation to the Lower 
Flammability Limit (LFL) of hydrogen (H2): 

Low Leakage (0 to 25% LFL):  Low leakage is defined as an amount of leaking fuel which leads to 
a fuel concentration in a fuel/air mixture below 25% of the LFL (1% volumetric H2 
concentration). Refer to ANSI/AIAA G-095-2004. 

Medium Leakage (25 to 50% LFL):  Medium leakage is defined as an amount of leaking fuel 
which leads to a fuel concentration in a fuel/air mixture between 25% and 50% of the LFL (1 to 
2% volumetric H2 concentration). 

High Leakage (>50% LFL):  High leakage is defined as an amount of leaking fuel which leads to a 
fuel concentration above 50% of the LFL (>2%) volumetric H2 concentration). 

Fire Zone:  A potential flammable fluid leakage zone that contains a nominal ignition 
source.  Note: This is not a Designated Fire Zone per § 25.1181. It is a zone where means to 
protect the airplane from the hazardous effects of fire may be required, but these means may 
differ from the fire protection means for designated fire zones per § 25.1181. 

Flammable Fluid Leakage Zone:  Any area where flammable liquids or vapors are not intended 
to be present, but where they might exist due to leakage from flammable fluid carrying 
components (e.g. leakage from tanks, lines, etc.). 

Flammability Limits: The lower flammability limit (LFL) and upper flammability limit (UFL) vapor 
concentrations (usually reported as percent by volume) of fuel in a flammable mixture that will 

246 

 
ignite and propagate a flame. These limits are functions of temperature, pressure, diluents, and 
ignition energy. 

Fuel Cell Stack:  That portion of the fuel cell system achieving electrochemical conversion of 
fuel and oxidant into electrical energy, thermal energy and exhaust gas. This includes the fuel 
cell housing, fittings, wiring and all devices allowing the connection to other subsystems. 

Fuel Cell System:  Those units and components using an electrochemical conversion process to 
produce electricity from a fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side). This 
includes reactants and reaction products, supply/exhaust devices, fuel cell stacks, electric 
power output devices, cooling or/and heating devices and a centralized control and monitoring 
subsystem. 

Fuel Supply:  Hydrogen gas or liquid and any other hydrocarbon fuel. 

Hydrogen Cloud:  A large volume of air-hydrogen mixture. 

Hazardous Area:  Defined as an area or space in which a hazardous condition, such as an 
explosive gas atmosphere, may be present in such quantities as to require precautions for the 
construction, installation and use of apparatus, in order to comply with the intended 
applications for civil aircraft. Refer to IEC 60079 Standards family. 

Ignition: The initiation of combustion. 

Ignition Sources:  Any process or event that is capable of causing a fire or an explosion. Open 
flames, sparks, static electricity and hot surfaces are possible ignition sources. 

Leak:  Refers to a leak in the hydrogen system. The consequences of a high pressure leak are 
more hazardous than a low pressure leak. 

Loss of Communication:  Refers to a loss of communication between the airplane and the fuel 
cell system. 

Loss of Power:  Refers to a loss of output power from the fuel cell system for any reason (i.e. 
the fuel cell is not providing its intended function). 

Lower Heating Value:  The heating value or calorific value is the total energy released as heat 
when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions.  
The lower heating value assumes that all the products of combustion remain gaseous.  The 
higher heating value assumes that water is condensed and thus includes the heat of 
vaporization (condensation) of the water vapor formed from hydrogen during combustion. 

Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP):  A term commonly used dealing with high 
pressure containers. It describes the maximum pressure to be seen inside the system under 
worst case but allowed operating conditions. Hence it is a normal operating and not a failure 
case. Proof and burst pressure are to be calculated from MAWP and not from nominal pressure 
at ISA temperature. 

247 

 
Microflame:  The minimum amount of hydrogen leakage that will support a flame 

Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE):  The minimum energy required for the ignition of a particular 
flammable mixture at a specified temperature and pressure. 

Nominal Ignition Source:  A flammable fluid ignition source, which is not associated with a 
failure condition. 

Normal Discharges:  Discharges expected during normal operation and not associated with 
failure conditions. 

Normal Operation:  All transient and steady state operating conditions according to the inflight 
envelope of the aircraft which occurs during start, intended operation and shut down which 
does not involve a component or system failure. 

Overpressure:  An overpressure in the high-pressure system which could lead to a tank or high 
pressure line exploding causing injury to personnel or damage to vehicle structure. Pressure 
relief devices are typically incorporated into tanks and high pressure lines to preclude this 
situation. 

Oxidant Supply:  The supply of an oxidizing agent; a substance that oxidizes another substance.  
This is generally air or pure oxygen. 

Permeation:  Diffusion through the walls or interstices of a container vessel, piping or interface 
material. 

Point of Release:  Interface where the ventilation exhaust or other discharges, potentially 
containing hazardous fluids, is expelled exterior to the aircraft. 

Potential Ignition Source:  A flammable fluid ignition source, which is associated with a failure 
condition. 

Potentially Unsafe Condition:  A condition that could lead to hazardous or catastrophic 
conditions according to CS25.1309, is defined as a potentially unsafe condition. Among these 
there are conditions caused by fluids and electrical voltages which have the potential to cause a 
hazard as follows: 

Flammability and Explosiveness:  Sufficient quantities of fuel/air mixtures at or above the 
Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) are flammable as well as sufficient quantities of fuel/air mixtures 
at or above the Lower Explosiveness Limit (LEL) are by explosive. Fuel/air mixtures below 25% 
of the LFL are considered nonhazardous.  Note the LFL of H2 in air is 4 vol%, where LFL = f(T,P), 
=> 4 vol% (1 bar, 25 °C) for upper propagation (ANSI G-095-2004, Table A2.2). 

High Pressure:  High-pressure fluids in the fuel supply, fuel cell stacks, and/or thermal 
management subsystem can transfer kinetic energy causing personal injury and damage to 
critical systems and structure. 

248 

 
Purges:  Normal discharges associated with the time limited removal of fluids or inert 
gases from fuel cell systems. 

Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell:  A fuel cell that employs proton exchange 
membrane as the electrolyte. 

Quenching distance:  The gap dimension required to prevent the propagation of an open flame 
through a flammable fuel-air mixture. 

Rapid Release of Pressure:  Refers to a rapid release of pressure from the hydrogen storage 
tank or lines. A high-pressure leak can propel a pressure vessel at high force and velocity 
potentially causing injury to personnel or damage to vehicle structure. 

Reformed Fuel:  The product of a fuel reformation process where hydrocarbon fuels are broken 
down into hydrogen rich gas which can be utilized directly or be further processed to be used as 
fuel for a fuel cell. 

Secondary Fire Load:  A secondary fire is the result of ignition of material by a primary fire. The 
secondary fire load is the amount of energy that is being released by the secondary fire after 
shut off of the primary fire. A secondary fire will extinguish either once all material is burned or 
the fire is self-extinguished due to the material selection or other adequate precautions. 

Start-Up Time:  Start-up refers to the processes and time required to turn-on a fuel cell until 
the time is it fully functioning and able to supply its rated power output. 

Stoichiometric Mixture:  A mixture in which both fuel and oxidizer are fully consumed 
(complete combustion) to form combustion product(s). The stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen 
mixture is composed of 66.66% by volume of hydrogen and 33.33% of oxygen. The 
stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen in air (assuming 21% of oxygen and 79% of nitrogen) 
is 29.59% by volume with air content of 70.41%. 

Thermal Management System:  Active heating or cooling of the fuel cell stacks and supporting 
equipment to maintain optimum power generation while ensuring the FCS in within normal 
operating limits. 

Uncontrolled Leak:  An uncontrolled leak is defined as a leak that is either not detected or 
cannot be controlled (i.e., stopped or kept at a safe leakage level) by the fuel cell system. 

Uncontrolled Fire:  An uncontrolled fire is a situation where the fuel supply to the fire cannot 
be shut-off or the fire is not detected. 

Ventilation:  Means of using the flow of air to dilute and remove potential hazardous gases 
from a controlled volume. Ventilation may be active or passive.

 ESD ARC CHARTER 

This appendix contains the original charter statement for the ESD ARC.  The charter was revised 
by the FAA Administrator on June 29, 2017, to extend ESD ARC’s duration until January 31, 
2018.  The revised charter instructed the committee to submit its report detailing 
recommendations no later than December 8, 2017.  Other than the date extension, no other 
changes to the charter where made.  Both charter statements can be found on the FAA 
Committee Database website at: 

http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/. 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
FEDERAL AVIATION  ADMINISTRATION 
Aviation Rulemaking Committee Charter 

Effective Date: 4/9/2015 

SUBJECT: 

Energy Supply Device Aviation Rulemaking Committee 

1.  PURPOSE.  This charter establishes the energy Supply Device Aviation Rulemaking 

Committee (ARC) according to the Administrator’s authority under Title 49 of the United 
States Code (49 U.S.C.) 106(p)(5).  The sponsor of this ARC is the Director of the Aircraft 
Certification Service and this charter outlines the committee organization, responsibilities, 
and tasks. 

2.  BACKGROUND.  The aviation industry has indicated significant interest in hydrogen fuel 

cells in airplanes. A hydrogen fuel cell produces electrical energy from hydrogen and oxygen 
reacting. Currently. the aviation industry is conducting research and pursuing efforts to 
install fuel cells on airplanes because fuel cells: 

a.  Are efficient sources of electric energy and produce usable waster and heat as 

byproducts; 

b.  Could significantly reduce airplane weight, emission of pollutant gases and· noise 

and 

c.  Support Europe's Clean Sky initiative. 

The aviation industry has been studying, performing tests and developing prototypes to 
support several applications of fuel cells on airplanes.  Some applications that have been 
discussed during industry meetings are as follows: 

a.  Use the electrical energy to replace an airplane’s main battery, ram air turbine and 

auxiliary power unit· 

251 

 
 
 
 
b.  Power equipment such as galley cookers, chillers coffee makers inflight 

entertainment systems, cargo unit load devices and medical equipment; and 

c.  Use the water produced as a byproduct to reduce the need for water refilling trucks 

and ground support equipment. 

Carrying hydrogen on-board an airplane creates safety issues that need to be understood 
and carefully addressed.  For example, hydrogen is highly combustible and, due to its small 
molecular size, commonly leaks. The FAA is tasking the Energy Supply Device ARC to 
develop a thorough understanding of the safety issues and appropriate installation 
requirements to support the FAA’s anticipated application for a fuel cell installation. 

The FAA considers hydrogen fuel cells to be a main driver in determining appropriate 
airworthiness standards for energy supply device installations associated with this ARC. 
However, FAA airworthiness standards should be written to be performance-based and 
should address all foreseeable energy supply device t pesto the greatest extent possible. 

3.  OBJECTIVES AND TASKS OF THE ARC. The Energy Supply Device ARC will provide a forum 
for the aviation community to discuss and provide recommendations to the FAA and is 
tasked to specifically: 

a.  Develop a plan for determining appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance 

for energy supply device installation, with a primary focus on transport airplanes but 
also considering other types of aircraft. 

b.  Identify hazards associated with installations of hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, ultra-
capacitors, and other energy supply devices on   transport airplanes and other types 
of aircraft. 

c.  Identify the designs and operational principles that may be used to safeguard 

against these hazards. 

d.  Identify the current rules in Title 14, Code of Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR) 

part 25 that are applicable for addressing energy supply device installations. 

e.  Determine proposed revisions of, and any   additions to, the applicable part 25 rules 
needed to provide an appropriate and adequate level of safety for energy supply 
device installations and operation. 

f.  Review the existing advisory circulars and FAA policy memorandums and statements 
that provide guidance relating to this subject and determine proposed revision s or 
additions to the guidance.  As a part of this effort, determine proposed guidance on 
the assumptions and approach that should be used to perform a safety assessment 
of these energy supply device installations. 

g.  Recommend appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance for energy supply 

device installations 

Recommendation Report. The Energy Supply Device ARC shall provide recommendations 
that may be used by the FAA to develop appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance 
for energy supply device installations on transport airplanes and other types of aircraft. The 
report should include: 

252 

 
a.  A list of the types of energy supply devices studied. 
b.  An explanation of all hazards associated with installing energy supply devices on 

airplanes. 

c.  Discussion on the designs and operational principles the ARC considers will be used 

to safeguard against these hazards. 

d.  An explanation of how the proposed airworthiness standards and guidance will 

sufficiently address all of the associated hazards. 

e.  Any additional information the ARC considers, in associated with the task, that 

would help the FAA further understand the recommendation. 

f.  Estimated costs associated with certification of each recommended energy supply 

device. 

4.  ARC PROCEDURES 

a.  The Energy Supply Device ARC acts solely in an advisory capacity by advising and 
providing written recommendations to the Director r of the Aircraft Certification 
Service and the Director of the Office of Rulemaking. 

b.  The Energy Supply Device ARC may propose additional tasks as necessary to the 

Director of the Aircraft Certification Service for approval. 

c.  Status Reports. The Energy Supply Device ARC will provide a status update to the 

Director of the Aircraft Certification Service every six months. 

d.  Recommendation Report. The Energy Supply Device ARC will submit a report 

i. 

detailing recommendations within 24 months from the effective date of the charter. 
The Indus try Co-Chair sends the recommendation report to both the 
Director of the Aircraft Certification Servicer and the Director of the Office 
of Rulemaking. 
The Director of the Aircraft Certification Service determines when the 
recommendation report is release d to the public. 

ii. 

e.  The Energy Supply Device ARC may reconvene following the submission of the 

recommendation report for the purposes of providing advice and assistance to the 
FAA. at the discretion of the Director of the Aircraft Certification Service, provided 
the charter is still in effect 

5.  ARC ORGANIZATION, MEMBERSHIP, AND ADMINISTRATION. The FAA will establish a 
committee of members of the aviation community. Members will be selected based on 
their familiarity with energy supply device design, operation, installation and regulatory 
compliance. Membership will be balanced in viewpoints. interests, and knowledge of the 
objectives and scope. 

The provisions of the August 13, 2014. Office of Management and Budget guidance, 
“Revised Guidance on Appointment of Lobbyists to Federal Advisory Committees, Boards, 
and Commissions" (79 FR 47482), continues the ban on registered lobbyists participating on 
Agency Boards and Commissions if participating in their “individual capacity." The revised 
guidance now allows registered lobbyists to participate on Agency Boards and Commissions 
in a “representative capacity" for the "express purpose of providing a committee with the 

253 

 
views of a nongovernmental entity. a recognizable group of persons or nongovernmental 
entities (an industry, sector, labor unions, or environmental groups, etc.) or state or local 
government". (For further inforn1ation see the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LOA) as
