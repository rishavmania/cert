16. Abstract 

The  safety  issues  for  use  of  a  proton  exchange  membrane  fuel  cell  (PEMFC)  system  providing  onboard  electrical  power  for  a 
commercial aircraft has been evaluated. Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. performed a failure mode and effects analysis on each of 
two potential applications. One PEMFC system was designated and designed for an application inside the aircraft cabin area and 
the other outside the aircraft cabin. These applications represent systems that require different levels of integration into the aircraft 
structure and represent electrical power requirements that are either critical or nonessential to safe aircraft operation. The operational 
risks identified for each application are similar, but the overall safety consequences are significantly different.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. (TESI) has been funded by the FAA to perform two failure mode 
and effects analyses (FMEAs) and associated validation testing for PEM Fuel Cells (PEMFC). The 
FMEAs serve as initial steps in identifying the risks associated with operating and maintaining a 
PEMFC system on a commercial aircraft.  

The  two  applications  for  study  were  selected  to  represent  contrasting  applications  to  cover  the 
broadest range of criteria relevant to aircraft safety. The two applications are: 

• 

• 

A PEMFC emergency power system (EPS) to replace the ram air turbine (RAT) currently 
used to generate emergency power from the airstream. 
A PEMFC medevac power system (MPS) to provide independent electrical power to the 
medical equipment on an aircraft dedicated to medevac service. 

Each application represents an electrical power requirement that is either critical to aircraft safety 
for the EPS or nonessential to aircraft operation for the MPS. The operational risks identified for 
either  application  are  in  many  cases  similar,  but  the  overall  safety  consequences  identified  are 
significantly different. 

For the studies, TESI has developed air-independent PEMFC system configurations and defined 
the operational procedures supporting several modes of operation for the two applications. The 
PEMFC stack for each application was designed for the appropriate power. System components 
were selected and sized to support the stack. Reactant storage vessels were sized to meet the overall 
energy requirement for the application. A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) has been 
developed for each system to show the relationship and function of all the components. The P&ID 
and a system block diagram are the principal references for each FMEA. 

The customary team-based FMEA procedure with a standard data-recording format was used to 
perform the analysis. The team met for 3 hours once a week for numerous weeks to complete the 
analysis for each study. The data were captured with commercial FMEA software. Overall study 
statistics and the individual risk levels of individual components are present in the report.   

The  FMEAs  provide  recommendations  on  issues  for  which  the  FAA  will  need  to  specify 
requirements for suppliers requesting to certify PEMFC systems for commercial aircraft service. 
The worksheets from the FMEA studies and a list of the recommendations are presented in the 
appendices.  

Following the analysis, a list of prospective tests was generated to support some of the assumptions 
used in the studies and some of the results from each of the FMEAs. The objective of these tests 
is to validate the causes and effects used for the various failure modes. Testing was completed on 
14 of the 17 tests proposed. The procedures and results are in the last appendix. Despite being 
exposed  to  extreme  and  severe  conditions,  the  PEMFC  performance  held  up,  and  some  cases 
exceeded expectations.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

There is  increasing interest in using fuel cell (FC) power systems on aircraft. Proton exchange 
membrane  fuel  cell  (PEMFC)  systems  are  maturing  and  used  in  automotive  and  industrial 
applications.  For  the  aircraft  industry,  there  are  potential  fuel  savings  and  carbon  emission 
reductions, but there are also substantial challenges. Specific power (W/kg) is lower than most 
power systems currently used on aircraft, so it is potentially heavier, and it uses hydrogen fuel, so 
it  creates  unfamiliar  hazards  and  operational  considerations.  In  support  of  the  FAA  interest  in 
realizing the use of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems onboard commercial 
aircraft, Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. (TESI) has performed separate failure mode and effects 
analyses (FMEAs) on two potential applications for commercial aircraft. A conceptual design has 
been developed for each PEMFC system, including component sizing and selection. A separate 
FMEA  has  been  performed  on  each  design  to  identify  high-risk  failure  modes.  Design 
improvements have been recommended to lower the high-risk failure modes, and component-level 
testing has been performed to validate the effect of select failure modes. 

The two applications were selected to represent contrasting applications for the broadest range of 
criteria  and  those  most  relevant  to  the  FAA.  The  PEMFC  systems  were  designed  to  provide 
electrical power for one application inside the aircraft cabin area and one outside the aircraft cabin. 
The  applications  represent  systems  requiring  different  levels  of  integration  into  the  aircraft 
structure.  They  also  represent  electrical  power  requirements,  which  can  be  considered  either 
critical  or  nonessential  to  safe  aircraft  operation.  The  operational  risks,  identified  for  either 
application, are similar, but the overall safety consequences are significantly different. Failure of 
the  nonessential  application  does  not  affect  aircraft  safety.  Critical  system  failure  prevents 
continued safe flight 

After selecting the two target applications, TESI contacted several aircraft and aircraft-component 
manufactures to provide system performance and operation requirements and to help evaluate how 
to integrate each system design into the aircraft. Possibly due to the nature of the project, a study 
of  failure  modes  of  onboard  equipment,  there  was  much  reluctance  from  those  in  the  aircraft 
industry to participate. Finally with the help of the FAA, TESI was able to get one participant for 
each application. Based on input from the aircraft manufacturers, the PEMFC systems were sized 
and designed to provide power for two commercial aircraft applications. 

2.  APPLICATION SELECTION 

The PEMFC system designs and the modes of operation chosen for each of the applications formed 
the basis for the FMEAs. The PEMFC stack for each application was designed for the appropriate 
power, and supporting components were selected and sized to support the stack. Reactant storage 
vessels  were  sized  to  meet  the  overall  energy  requirement  for  the  application.  A  piping  and 
instrumentation diagram (P&ID) has been developed for each system to show the relationship and 
function of all the components. This is an important reference for use in performing the FMEA. 
The P&ID with the design parameters and operation limits, along with a listing of the components 
and their features, have been created as part of the design effort. Also a list of system interfaces 
and a system layout block diagram have been developed. The descriptions that follow provide the 
assumptions selected for operation of the PEMFC systems specifically for each application.  

1 

 
TESI has performed an FMEA on each PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) system design for two different 
aircraft  applications.  The  first  application  studied  is  an  emergency  power  PEMFC  system  that 
replaces the present ram air turbine (RAT) on a narrow-body commercial aircraft platform (B737 
or A320 class). This application requires a high level of integration into the aircraft, providing a 
critical  source  of  reserve  power.  The  reserve  power  is  required  for  only  1  hour  but  must  be 
available to provide full power in 6 seconds. The quick-start requirement makes it necessary to 
have  the  PEMFC  system  in  a  continuous,  warm  standby  condition.  The  permanent  standby 
condition is unusual for a PEMFC application and became a major consideration in the FMEA. In 
addition to the continuous standby and very short power-production modes of operation, a pre-
flight check mode has been specified and studied to ensure system availability when needed.  

The  second  PEMFC  application  studied  is  power  for  use  with  a  medevac  system  on  a  mid-  to  
large-size business class jet aircraft. This system provides continuous independent power for up to 
8  hours.  The  system  is  portable,  not  constrained  to  the  aircraft,  so  it  can  be  installed  and  then 
removed to allow the aircraft to be used for other functions. The system runs with the conventional 
startup,  continuous  power  production,  and  shutdown  modes  of  PEMFC  operation.  A  standby 
condition is not required for the medevac application. 

Both  applications  are  run  as  air-independent  PEMFC  systems,  using  pressurized  hydrogen  and 
oxygen gas for reactants. The use of pressurized tanks for H2 is currently the most advanced and 
simplest  form  of  H2  storage.  Tanks  and  associated  valves  and  instrumentation  have  been 
developed for pressures  up to 700  bar (10,000  psia)  for  use  in  the  automotive  market. A more 
conservative H2 storage pressure of 350 bar (5000 psia) has been selected for use in the two aircraft 
applications  studied  here.  There  is  a  greater  availability  of  tanks  and  components  rated  at  this 
pressure. Both designs use Type 3 vessels, which include an aluminum liner to minimize hydrogen 
loss by diffusion.  

The use of pressurized  O2 allows the PEMFC systems to run independently of the aircraft air-
pressurization system. This enables self-sufficient operation at high altitude without the need for 
an air compressor. Air-independent operation with a closed oxygen cathode loop eliminates the 
need for humidifiers on an incoming air stream. The only interaction the reactants have with the 
environment is a periodic purge of accumulated inert gases, which build up over time. The direct 
use of oxygen also  ensures high-efficiency  energy  conversion,  which  minimizes the  amount of 
heat required to be rejected. An O2 storage pressure of 200 bar (3000 psia) has been selected for 
both applications. This pressure is currently the maximum allowable for most industrial gaseous 
oxygen systems.  

2.1  EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEM—EPS 

The EPS is located in the space currently occupied by the RAT emergency power system. 

Figure 1 outlines the main components. The H2 and O2 tanks are fixed in the system structure and 
are filled in place. The liquid to air heat exchanger is part of a self-contained thermal control system 
that  rejects  process  heat  to  the  ambient  conditions  in  the  unconditioned  space  surrounding  the 
system. The design of the fuel cell stack allows the coolant to contain a  glycol  antifreeze. The 
antifreeze  coolant  prevents  freezing  in  the  heat  exchanger,  coolant  tank,  coolant  circuit 

2 

 
components, and fuel cell stack when the system is not in the active standby condition. The P&ID 
in appendix A details all the system components that were considered in the FMEA.  

Figure 1. EPS layout 

The EPS must be ready to come online immediately and provide up to 30kW of critical emergency 
power at 230 Vac. The system operates outside of the conditioned cabin and receives reactants 
from pressurized hydrogen and oxygen storage. Both product water and hydrogen, and oxygen 
from system relief valves, are vented overboard. The hydrogen and oxygen vent purge valves are 
vented to the ambient-air environment surrounding the system. The system uses a self-contained 
thermal control system, which rejects heat to the same surrounding air environment.

The amount of ventilation through the space surrounding the system is currently undefined so that 
it was not possible for the study to assess the allowable level of a hydrogen leak that remains below 
an  acceptable  lower  explosion  limit  (LEL).  This  issue  resulted  in  a  recommendation  (EPS 
Recommendation Reference #8) for further review of the ventilation features of the space and an 
acceptable method of detecting the hydrogen concentration level.

2.1.2  EPS – Modes of Operation 

Three modes of operation are defined for the PEMFC EPS. They include the following: 

• 
• 

• 

Pre-flight—check for fluid fills and to verify FC stack functionality   
Standby—maintain the system operating temperature for immediate full power 
availability 
Emergency power production—provide independent FC stack power for flight control 

The pre-flight fluid check is intended to verify that the reactant and the coolant subsystems are 
filled with fluids. Additionally, the functionality of many of the EPS components is checked before 
placing  the  system  in  the  standby  mode.  Pressure  and  temperature  readings  are  checked  to  be 
within an acceptable range to confirm that they are functioning. Electrical power for the pre-flight 
mode originates from the main power of the aircraft. 

The  pre-flight  check  monitors  the  reactant  storage  pressure  transducers  (PT1,  PT2)  for  correct 
reactant  storage  pressure  and  the  inlet  pressure  transducers  (PT5,  PT6)  for  correct  reactant 
pressures at the FC inlets. The coolant pump (M3) is operated, and the level sensor (L3) and flow 
sensor (FS1) are monitored for acceptable coolant level and flow. The coolant tank heater (HT1) 
is turned on to check that it is functioning, and the temperature sensors (T1 and T2) are monitored 
to check that they are responding.  

The inlet isolation valves (SV1, SV2) are opened and the vent valves (SV5, SV6) are closed to 
allow  the  reactants  to  pressurize  the  FC  stack.  Following  the  stack  pressurization  process,  the 
individual cell voltages are monitored for acceptable levels at the open-circuit condition. With the 
stack pressurized, the reactant pumps (M1, M2) are operated momentarily, and the current draw 
on each pump motor is monitored to verify pump operation.  

After an acceptable pre-flight check, the FC stack is evacuated. The inlet valves (SV1, SV2) and 
vent valves  (SV5,  SV6) are  closed. A small resistance load is applied to the FC stack, and the 
reactants are consumed. As the pressure in the stack drops the hydrogen inlet isolation valve (SV1) 
is  cycled  to  provide  enough  hydrogen  to  maintain  a  stoichiometric  mix  for  complete  reaction. 
When the evacuation is complete, the system enters the standby mode. 

In the standby mode, the EPS continues to use main aircraft power. The coolant pump remains on, 
and the heater in the coolant tank is turned on. The coolant subsystem remains active, allowing the 
temperature to rise to the operating temperature. When the temperature reaches the operating point 
at the inlet temperature sensor (T3), it is actively controlled and maintained by cycling the heater 
on and off to maintain the system at the operating temperature.  

The inlet isolation valves (SV1, SV2) and the vent valves (SV5, SV6) remain closed in the standby 
mode.  All  the  EPS  instrumentation  remains  active,  monitoring  the  conditions  in  each  reactant 
subsystem  and  the  coolant  subsystem.  The  standby  mode  keeps  the  FC  stack  at  the  operating 
temperature, ready to quickly provide emergency power if needed. 

When main aircraft power is lost and emergency power is requested, a battery in the FC control 
subsystem  initiates  independent  FC  control.  The  inlet  isolation  valves  (SV1,  SV2)  are  open  to 

5 

 
pressurize the FC stack subsystem. The pressurization procedure takes several seconds, after which 
FC control power is maintained autonomously by the FC system itself. Full power can be delivered 
to the aircraft electrical load at this time. The reactants can provide 30kW of continuous power for 
1  hour.  The  coolant  subsystem  provides  active  thermal  control.  The  water  management 
components (WT1, WT2, LS1, LS2) process and monitor the product water. The vent and drain 
valves (SV3, SV4, SV5, SV6) remain active. 

Shutdown of the system is initiated by the consumption of all stored reactants or removal of all 
control power to the FC system. The normally closed inlet valves (SV1, SV2) isolate the FC stack 
from  the  reactant  supply.  The  normally  closed  vent  valves  (SV5,  SV6)  capture  any  remaining 
reactants in the FC stack.  

2.2  MEDEVAC POWER SYSTEM – MPS 

The MPS  is located in the rear luggage compartment, which is accessible from the  cabin.  It is 
removable so that the aircraft can be reconfigured for applications other than medevac. The MPS 
is installed and removed through the luggage compartment exterior access hatch. Figure 2 outlines 
the main components. Exchangeable H2 and O2 tanks are used for refueling.  

The liquid-to-air heat exchanger is part of a self-contained thermal control system, which rejects 
processed heat to the ambient conditions in the luggage compartment and the adjacent cabin. The 
aircraft HVAC system can handle a supplemental heat load of up to 5kW. The PEMFC system 
rejects 4300W.  

Air-independent operation of the PEMFC allows a closed loop, oxygen reactant system to be used. 
This eliminates the need to consume cabin oxygen content. The use of oxygen  also maximizes 
energy conversion efficiency, which minimizes heat load to the aircraft HVAC system. The P&ID 
in  appendix  B  details  all  the  system  components  that  were  considered  in  the  FMEA  for  the 
medevac system.

Figure 2. MPS layout 

The gas-venting locations—including high-pressure venting for the reactant storage, system relief 
valves,  and  H2  purge—were  selected  for  a  specific  aircraft.  The  high-pressure  H2  vent  leaves 
behind the rear-mounted engines to avoid dumping H2 into the engine intake. The high-pressure 
O2 vent is through the luggage compartment hatch. The intermittent low-pressure h2 purge also 
vents through the hatch. The low-pressure O2 purge vents into the luggage compartment. A tank 
to contain the water produced by the system is included in the system. This tank is drained when 
the system is refueled. 

The  PEMFC  system  for  the  MPS  application  is  self-controlled  with  alarms  and  shutdowns  for 
individual failure modes. H2 detection in the luggage compartment is interlocked to the FC system 
to provide system shutdown if a hydrogen concentration of 2% (50%  LEL) is exceeded and to 
provide an alarm at 25% LEL.  

The conditioned interior space of the aircraft, including the cabin and luggage compartment, is 
approximately  1150  ft3.  It  is  ventilated  to  meet  the  0.55  lbm/min  per  occupant  requirement 
(FAR25) for fresh air. This is equivalent to 100 cu ft/min for standard aircraft air conditions (10.9 
psia,  72°F)  when  certified  for  10  occupants.  At  this  rate  of  ventilation,  an  H2  leak  of  up  to  
2 cu ft/min will remain under the allowable 50% LEL (2%) concentration. The time response for 
this leak (designated as 1x) and leaks of 2x and 4x are shown in figure 3. The time durations for 
leaks of 1x, 2x, and 4x to reach 50% LEL are 1 hour, 8 minutes, and 4 minutes, respectively. As a 
point of reference, these volumetric leak rates can be compared to the total hydrogen consumption 
rate of the PEMFC at full power. This represents a leak rate equivalent to all the hydrogen required 
for producing power. At standard aircraft conditions (10.9 psia, 72°F) this rate is 2.4 cu ft/min.

2.2.2  MPS—Modes of Operation 

Three conventional modes of operation are defined for the PEMFC medevac power system (MPS). 
They are the following: 

• 
• 
• 

Startup—pressurize fuel cell stack and bring system up to operating temperature   
Power production—provide independent FC stack power for medevac service 
Shutdown—safely remove load and depressurize system 

Battery  power,  required  only  for  initial  MPS  startup,  is  maintained  in  the  controls  subsystem 
located within the fuel-cell stack and BOP envelope. Before energizing the FC stack, the reactant 
storage  pressures  (PT1,  PT2)  and  the  coolant  liquid  level  (LS3)  are  checked  for  the  proper 
amounts. Activating the FC stack begins by opening the normally closed inlet valves (SV1, SV2) 
to pressurize the stack with reactants. Individual cell voltages are monitored for acceptable level 
at the open circuit condition. After initial startup, system controls are powered by the fuel cell. 
Startup continues with an electrical load applied to the FC stack from the bootstrap heater in the 
coolant tank. The heater brings the system up to operating temperature, at which time the coolant 
subsystem begins to provide active thermal control. 

The  startup  process  also  provides  an  opportunity  for  all  the  instrumentation  in  the  MPS  to  be 
monitored  for  accuracy.  Pressure,  temperature,  level,  and  flow  readings  should  be  within  their 
acceptable  range.  Errant  readings  can  cause  system  alarms,  which  may  lead  to  diagnostic 
procedures for instrument calibration. 

9 

 
Following startup the MPS provides direct 28Vdc power to the medevac service load from 1.5 to 
5 kW for up to 8 hours. The coolant subsystem provides active thermal control, rejecting heat from 
a liquid to air heat exchanger (HX1) to the ambient air conditions in the aircraft. The product water 
traps within the FC subsystem (WT1, WT2) collect and deliver excess product water into a product 
water tank (V4). 

After removing the medevac service load the MPS production is shut down by closing the reactant 
supply.  Isolation  valves  (SV1,  SV2)  and  vent  valves  (SV5,  SV6)  are  allowed  to  go  to  their 
normally closed position. The stack is evacuated by applying a small resistance load to the FC 
stack and allowing the reactants to be fully consumed. The stack remains in the vacuum state until 
the next startup process. 

3.  FMEA ANALYSIS 

An FMEA is a methodology described as a systematic group of activities intended to recognize 
and evaluate the potential failures of a product or process and its effects. A potential failure mode 
is defined as the manner in which an item (component or system) could potentially fail to meet the 
function or design intent of the item. Often defined as anti-functions, failure modes are identified 
as specifically as possible and described in physical terms. The analysis lists all potential failure 
modes for each item and item function. Potential effects of failure are defined as the effect of the 
failure on the function of the item. Effects may also extend to the higher sub-system or system 
level. The goal is to identify actions that could eliminate or reduce the probability of the potential 
failure occurring.  

It is important to have a logging system in place to document the analysis as it progresses in real 
time. TESI uses FMEA-Pro8, a process hazardous analysis software package from Dyadem, to 
record and track the results as the analysis progresses. The software also provides various reports 
and charts to summarize the analysis and identify the failures with the highest risk. 

3.1  FMEA METHODOLOGY 

The  FMEA  begins  by  dividing  the  system  into  workable  nodes.  These  nodes  are  identified  as 
sections  or  subsystems  with  similar  process  functions  on  a  process  schematic  or  a  P&ID.  The 
P&IDs for both the EPS and MPS are divided in to four nodes: hydrogen storage, oxygen storage, 
fuel-cell sub-system, and coolant sub-system. The  normal design conditions  are  listed for  each 
node. All components subject to potential failure are listed in FMEA-Pro8 for each node, as called 
out on the P&ID.  

The  main  activity  of  the  FMEA  process  is  accomplished  with  a  team.  A  group  of  individuals 
familiar with the system is assembled to investigate potential failures for each of the components. 
The team determines causes, effects, and controls for each failure mode. Effects are determined 
without  consideration  of  any  controls  that  may  be  in  place  and  assigned  a  numerical  severity. 
Causes for each potential failure mode are assigned probability of occurrence. A level of detection 
is also assigned representing the probability that the deviation will be discovered. The product of 
the  severity,  occurrence,  and  detection  levels  is  the  numerical  risk  or  the  risk  priority  number 
(RPN). The process continues for each component. 

10 

 
Recommendations are required to be recorded for all elevated failure risks. The recommendations 
are  intended  to  offer  suggestions  for  further  study  to  provide  design  improvements  that  will 
mitigate  the  high  risk.  In  some  cases,  recommendations  were  recorded  for  lower-level  risks  to 
indicate potential design enhancements or to note and explain existing features that are currently 
in place. 

The study data are entered into a worksheet in the FMEA-Pro8 software. An example worksheet 
is shown in figure 4. The process is repeated for the entire system for each of the system operating 
modes. The operational modes for the EPS and MPS are listed and described in sections 2.1.2 and 
2.2.2. 

Figure 4. FMEA example worksheet  

The FMEA team for the EPS application included the following individuals: Mike Miller, Bob 
Wynne,  Rob  Utz,  all  of  whom  are  TESI  employees,  and  Charles  Lo,  who  is  with  Honeywell 
Aerospace. The team met for 3 hours once a week for 7 weeks during April and May 2017. The 
team studied all the components in all four system nodes of the EPS (hydrogen storage, oxygen 
storage, fuel cell sub-system, and coolant sub-system), operating in three different modes (pre-
flight, standby, and power production). 

The team for the MPS application included: Mike Miller, Bob Wynne, Rob Utz, and Stu Pass, all 
from TESI. The team met for 3 hours once a week for 5 weeks during July and August 2017. The 
team studied all the components in all four system nodes of the MPS in three different operating 
modes (startup, power production, and shutdown). 

11 

 
 
3.2  FMEA CATEGORIES 

The number of levels of severity (S) for each deviation and the number of levels of occurrence (O) 
and detection (D) must be large enough to provide reasonable differentiation but not too large to 
be overly cumbersome and time consuming during the team sessions. For this FMEA, TESI used 
four levels for each category with a corresponding definition increasing the significance at each 
level. The four levels with their definition for each category are listed in table 3.

are listed in table 4.

3.3  FMEA RESULTS SUMMARY 

Results for both studies in each of their three operational modes are summarized in the following 
sections. The numbers in the overall statistics tables include totals, averages, and maximum values 
in several categories for each mode of operation. The statistics show the broad scope of the studies 
and the overall risk for each of the operational modes. For either application, the numbers indicate 
only a slight difference  in  overall  risk between  the  three modes of operation. The overall risk-
ranking charts (figures 5 and 6) show the overall risk for various levels of severity and occurrence. 
Again, the overall levels and trends are similar for each of the three modes of operation for both 
applications.

Figure 6. MPS overall risk ranking charts 

The  importance  of  the  pre-flight  mode  and  the  long  standby  mode  condition  for  the  EPS 
application is even more evident when looking at the overall component risk rankings in table 6. 
The higher number of maximum RPNs for both pre-flight and standby emphasize a need to focus 
on the higher risk components regardless of the operational mode.  

A significant difference in risk is more evident when comparing the risk ranking by component 
tables (tables 6 and 8). These tables show the importance of conducting the FMEA on a detailed 
component-by-component basis for all operational modes. The risk ranking by component tables 
show a significant difference in risk for some components depending on the mode of operation. 
Recommendations  for  follow-on  design  and  analysis  are  made  based  on  high  risk  failures 
identified for the individual components.  

3.3.1  FMEA Results – EPS Summary 

The EPS application requires power production for only a short period. The preparation during 
pre-flight and the system condition during standby are important for reliable operation during this 
critically short time. The overall statistics shown in table 5 indicate that although the number of 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
failure modes, effects, and causes are fewer for the pre-flight and standby modes, the average risk 
per cause is higher. This is partly due to a higher number of maximum RPNs for these two modes. 
The  3D  plots  in  figure  5  show  a  wider  distribution  of  overall  severity  and  occurrence  for  the  
power-production  mode,  but  the  maximum  RPNs  are  the  same.  The  statistics  indicate  the 
importance for considering both pre-flight and standby issues in the EPS design.

3.3.2  FMEA Results—MPS Summary 

Throughout the mission cycle of the application, the operational modes of the MPS are typical of 
most  PEM  fuel  cell  applications.  Short  startup  and  shutdown  operational  modes  precede  and 
follow a longer power-production mode. The overall statistics for MPS study are shown in table 
7. The number of causes, effects, and failure modes are higher for the extended power-production 
mode;  however,  the  average  RPN  per  cause  is  lower  because  of  the  higher  number  of  design 
controls that exist during power production. The 3D plots in figure 6 show a similar distribution 
of overall severity and occurrence and the same maximum RPN for all three operational modes.

Similar to table 6, table 8 shows the importance of looking at the overall risks for individual 
components operating in modes other than power production. The larger number of high RPNs 
for both startup and shutdown emphasize a need to concentrate on all the high-risk components.

4.  RECOMMENDATIONS 

Detailed recommendation statements are the final product of the FMEA. The recommendations 
are in most cases related to specific design issues that resulted from failure modes with the higher 
risk  (RPN)  values.  They  are  actions  that  should  be  taken  in  the  product-development  phase  to 
further  refine  the  design  to  reduce  the  risk.  In  some  cases,  the  recommendation  references  a 

19 

 
standard design process, procedure, or control in place that minimizes any expected risk from the 
failure mode being considered. 

Each recommendation has an EPS or MPS reference number followed by a short descriptive phase. 
A reference to the component numbers used in the system P&ID and the modes of operation being 
considered are also listed. Some similar failure modes from the two studies resulted in the same 
recommendations. Some recommendations for each study are repeated in the following sections 
to maintain the complete set of recommendations for each application 

4.1  RECOMMENDATIONS—EPS 

EPS Reference #1—Consider adding filter downstream of reactant pump.  

(M1, M2)—Power production mode 

A failure mode can occur where the reactant pumps (M1 or M2) fail and produce contaminants 
that can then enter the FC stack. Adding a filter downstream of the reactant pumps will protect the 
FC stack from these contaminants. An additional filter should be considered at the exit of the FC 
reactant lines to protect the solenoid valves and reactant pumps from particles that could exit the 
FC stack, such as carbon fibers from the GDLs. 

EPS Reference #2—Consider redundancy, also look at maintenance issues.  

(MV2, MV4)—Standby mode 

A failure can occur where the manual valves feeding the fuel cell system, located at the exit of the 
reactant storage tanks, fail closed. These valves are closed during refueling to isolate the filling 
process  from  the  FC  system.  When  the  valves  are  closed,  the  downstream  pressure  will  be 
maintained so there is no way to verify that the valve actually reopened. Adding a second manual 
valve in parallel with the existing ones will decrease the risk of a valve failing closed. 

EPS Reference #3—Consider redundant level switches in water separators.  

(LS1, LS2)—Power-production mode 

A failure can occur if the level switch detects water when there is none. This will continually open 
SV3 or SV4 resulting in loss of reactant or reactant pressure at the FC stack. A second level switch 
can  be  added  to  minimize  occurrence.  An  option  to  adding  a  second  switch  is  to  generate  an 
algorithm that will close the solenoid valves after a predetermined time even if the level switch 
detects  water.  To  ensure  the  solenoid  valve  is  not  plugged,  the  algorithm  can  wait  for  a 
corresponding loss in FC reactant pressure prior to closing the solenoid valve. 

EPS Reference #4—Consider second PT to indicate adequate flow as indicated by pressure drop 
(M1, M2)–Power production mode. 

A failure can occur where the reactant pump(s) stop operating and the fuel cell performance decays 
because of flooding. Adding pressure transducers at the FC reactant outlet lines allows the system 
to monitor differential pressure across the FC to ensure adequate velocity to remove product water. 

20 

 
These additional pressure transducers also give redundancy for the existing ones. A second option 
is to measure reactant pump electrical current draw to indicate pump RPM, which relates to flow. 

EPS Reference #5—Include a monitor for current draw on reactant recirculation pump.  

(M1, M2)—Power production mode 

See Reference #4 above 

EPS Reference #6—Include a thermal switch on V3 for redundancy.  

(HT1)—Power production and standby modes 

Currently,  there  is  not  a  temperature  sensor  in  the  coolant  tank  where  the  coolant  heaters  are 
located. The temperature sensor at the fuel cell coolant inlet controls the coolant heater. An over 
temperature thermal switch will provide an additional safety factor to ensure the coolant tank never 
overheats. 

EPS Reference #7—Include a way to verify reactant tank PT accuracy. 

(PT1, PT2)—Pre-flight mode 

See reference #34 below 

EPS Reference #8—Investigate detection methods for external H2 leak.  

(M1, WT1, V1, FC1-H2)—Power production and standby modes 

A  failure  can  occur  if  a  hydrogen  leak  develops  that  increases  the  environmental  hydrogen 
concentration  to  a  dangerous  level  and  ignites.  A  hydrogen-detection  method  would  provide 
valuable information. A continuous flow of atmospheric air would purge the space around the FC 
system and a hydrogen detector placed where the flow exits (ideally at the top of the space). Testing 
may be necessary to ensure a COTS hydrogen detector will work effectively at the temperatures 
and ventilation flow rates the system will be exposed to. 

EPS Reference #9—Investigate water-trap freezing possibility.  

(WT1, WT2)—Standby mode 

A failure can occur after the FC system has been operating, and residual water remains in the water 
separator well. When the aircraft is not in use and the ambient temperatures fall below 0ºC, the 
water  will  freeze  and  potentially  damage  the  water  separator.  Provisions  must  be  allowed  for 
freezing  temperatures  by  either  draining  all  residual  water  during  pre-flight  checkouts  or  by 
making the water separators freeze-tolerant. An algorithm can be developed that opens each water 
separator solenoid drain valve towards completion of the pre-flight check-outs, ensuring they are 
empty. Alternatively, the water separators may be designed so that, as the residual water in the 
separators freezes, it has the ability to expand without damaging the separator. 

EPS Reference #10—Monitor coolant flow and stack temp for presence of coolant.  

21 

 
(LS3) – Standby mode 

A failure can occur if  the coolant tank  level sensor stops working and the true coolant  level is 
unknown. Using a coolant flow sensor (FS1) will provide evidence that there is adequate coolant 
to operate the system. Monitoring the coolant flow sensor along with the FC stack temperature 
provides an indication of sufficient coolant volume for near-term operation. 

EPS Reference #11—Compute total product water available for worst-case flooding risk.  

(WT1, WT2)—Power-production mode 

The failure of the product water trap in either the hydrogen or oxygen recirculation circuits could 
allow  the  direct  release  of  product  water  from  the  traps  and  cause  flooding  externally  into  the 
system  enclosure.  The  worst-case  level  of  flooding  is  determined  by  the  amount  of  reactants 
available  to produce  water. The short mission of  this application limits the amount  of onboard 
reactants. The mass of onboard reactants total about 13 kg, which could produce 13 liters of water. 
This volume is slightly more than 1% of the total volume of the EPS PEMFC system enclosure. 
Although  this  volume  is  small,  the  location  of  components  in  overall  system  design  should  be 
addressed to prevent flooding of sensitive components.  

EPS Reference #12—Consider monitoring stack pressure rise for detecting coolant leak.  

(FC1-C)—Standby mode 

During the lengthy standby mode, the anode and cathode half cells of the fuel cell stack are left in 
vacuum  condition  while  the  adjacent  coolant  sections  of  the  stack  maintain  stack  operating 
temperature with flowing, heated coolant. Major leakage of the coolant into either the anode or 
cathode could flood the stack, or a minor leak of a coolant containing antifreeze  coolant could 
possibly  poison  the  catalyst.  This  recommendation  raises  the  question  of  whether  a  detectable 
increase in pressure is present from a coolant leak. Can the result of the vapor pressure from a 
coolant leak  be  detected? This should be calculated or simulated.  If this  pressure is significant 
enough to detect, then testing could be done to validate the results. 

EPS Reference #13—Describe control to limit product water accumulation based on amp-hr count 
and its use as a secondary control/alarm.  

(LS1, LS2)—Power-production mode 

The failure of the level switch on either the hydrogen or oxygen water trap could lead to the drain 
valve not being actuated and the water trap overflowing. This would lead to excess water in the 
reactant  recirculation  circuit  and  flood  of  the  fuel  cell  stack.  TESI  uses  a  control  algorithm  to 
compute product water production. Fuel cell amperage is directly proportional to the consumption 
rate of the hydrogen and oxygen reactants and the production rate of product water. The controller 
stores accumulated fuel cell amperage over time and determines when to open the drain valve. The 
drain event is allotted a certain amount of time. If the level switch does not reset after this event, 
an alarm will normally trigger a shutdown due to a defective level switch. However, for this critical 
application, the control algorithm should continue to run to extend the run time as long as possible.  

22 

 
EPS Reference #14—Describe how heater should be sized for system heat loss and how to size 
HTX1 for additional HT1 heat load.  

(HT1)—Power-production, standby, and preflight modes 

The coolant heater for this application is more than the standard bootstrap heater used for providing 
quick system startup. The heater is independently powered and must be sized to provide continuous 
heat to maintain the fuel cell system at its operating temperature in a high-altitude environment to 
provide immediate full power to the power-production mode from standby. The liquid-to-air heat 
exchanger for the system must be sized to remove the heat supplied by the coolant heater in a wide 
range of environmental conditions, including all ground-based environments to which the aircraft 
may be exposed. 

EPS Reference #15—Describe how to size RV3/RV4 for full high-pressure storage flow. 

(FPR1, FPR2)—Power-production and standby modes 

Relief valves RV3 and RV4 protect the FC system from potential high-pressure exposure due to 
the failure of either of the forward pressure regulators, FPR1 or FPR2. These relief valves must be 
sized  large  enough  to  prevent  excessive  pressure  buildup  at  the  inlets  of the  isolation  solenoid 
valves SV1 or SV2. If fully opened, when the failed flow condition of the selected FPRs is not 
restricted enough, a flow-restriction orifice may need to be added downstream of each FPR. 

EPS Reference #16—Describe sizing orifice restriction to allow low-pressure operation. 

(SV3, SV4, SV5, & SV6)—Power-production mode 

If any of the vent or drain valves downstream of the fuel stack fail open, there will be a large loss 
of reactants out of those vents. The use of flow-control orifices at all gas outlets will minimize the 
loss of reactants and allow longer run time then without the orifice. These orifices can be sized to 
limit flow to the sonic, choked flow condition when the pressure drop to the environment is high, 
such as at the higher altitudes. 

EPS Reference #17—Develop an algorithm to indicate adequate coolant volume based on coolant 
flow and stack temp. 

(LS3)—Power-production mode. 

For  this  critical  application,  the  system  should  continue  to  operate  if  the  coolant  level  switch 
indicates low coolant. An alternate method of monitoring adequate coolant flow volume should be 
developed based on the inlet and outlet stack coolant temperature difference. The monitor should 
consider the fuel cell output and the temperature difference to estimate the thermal capacitance 
and resulting coolant flow. 

EPS Reference #18—Examine heater vs. fan thermal control (or both) while on standby. 

(HTX1)—Standby mode 

23 

 
Power  for  maintaining  the  operational  temperature  of  the  fuel  cell  coolant  during  standby 
originates from main aircraft power. During the power-production mode, the power for thermal 
control  is  independently  provided  by  the  fuel  cell  system.  Several  possible  thermal  control 
configurations during the standby mode should be considered during system design.  

•  Coolant pump power and on/off control of the coolant heater power provided by an 

aircraft control system using remote temperature sensors from the fuel cell. 

•  Coolant pump and heater power provided by the aircraft. On/off control of the coolant 
heater power performed by the fuel cell control system using power supplied from the 
aircraft. 

•  Coolant pump and heater power provided by the aircraft. On/off control of the coolant 

heat exchanger fan performed by the fuel cell control system using power supplied from 
the aircraft. 

•  A combination of 2 and 3. Heat is supplied by heater and removed by heat exchanger. 

EPS Reference #19—Examine risk of continued operation during slow reactant leak. 

(M1, M2, WT1, FC1-H2 &O2)—Power production and standby modes 

The risk associated with a slow external hydrogen leak is both a safety and a shortened run-time 
risk. The risk associated with a slow oxygen leak is a reduced run-time risk. Monitoring storage 
pressure will provide an indication of the level of the leak. In the standby mode, a decline in storage 
pressure  is  a  direct  indication  of  leak.  In  the  power-production  mode,  the  rate  of  consumption 
needs to be included in the controls computation for potential reactant leakage. 

EPS Reference #20—Include a short pressure release to verify vent valve function. 

(SV5, SV6)—Preflight mode 

During the preflight check, the system is pressurized to check that the system is leak free. This 
recommendation proposes a short pressure release be included in the preflight check to verify vent 
valve function. Before the final stack evacuation process, the isolation valves are closed and the 
vent valves are cycled to produce a small, uniform pressure release in both the anode and cathode 
sides of the fuel cell stack. After an acceptable pressure release, the FC can be fully evacuated 
before entering the standby mode. 

EPS Reference #21—Include DP alarm PT5/PT6. 

(FPR1, FPR2)—Standby mode 

During  the  standby  mode,  the  forward  pressure  regulators,  FPR1  and  FPR2,  are  expected  to 
maintain the correct reactant inlet pressure to the fuel cell stack. This recommendation proposes 
that the differences of the downstream pressure of the two FPRs be monitored for consistency. A 
shift in this pressure difference may produce an alarm indicating  a potential fault in one of the 
FPRs. 

EPS Reference #22—Include PT redundancy check in controls. 

24 

 
(PT1, PT2, PT3, PT4, PT5, PT6)—Power-production mode 

The need for redundant PTs on reactant storage tanks is addressed in recommendation reference 
#34. The four pressure transducers in the reactant lines downstream of the FPRs can also provide 
a certain degree of redundancy during the power-production mode. If functioning correctly, all 
four  should  read  relatively  close.  A  single  out-of-range  reading  probably  indicates  a  defective 
instrument. Dual readings for the same reactant, which are in agreement but out of range, probably 
indicates a shortage of reactant. 

EPS Reference #23—Investigate method to detect an H2 leak into coolant. 

(FC1-H2)—Power-production and preflight modes 

The interface material between the reactant cavities and the coolant cavities within the TESI fuel 
cell stack is solid, nonporous graphite. Any possible leakage of hydrogen into the coolant would 
potentially come from the sealing surfaces between the manifolds of the stack. The present coolant 
system is not a tightly sealed configuration. A large leak would be detected as a loss of reactant 
test pressure during the preflight check but would not be detected during operation. Small leaks 
would not be detected as reactant pressure changes. A sealed coolant system could be considered 
as a means to detect a pressure change due to reactant leakage into the coolant.  

EPS Reference #24—Investigate method to detect an O2 leak into coolant. 

(FC1-O2)—Power-production mode 

See reference #23. The larger oxygen molecule is less likely to leak into the coolant; however, a 
sealed coolant system should be considered. 

EPS Reference #25—Investigate water trap freezing possibility. 

(SV3, SV4, WT1, WT2)—Standby mode 

Generally, a small amount of product water is left in the bottom of the sump of the water trap to 
prevent the loss of reactant when water is pushed out during the draining process. The possibility 
of this water freezing seems remote because the fuel cell system is heated during the standby mode. 
However, there may be occasions when the aircraft is grounded, without power, in a subfreezing 
environment. A method of eliminating all of the water in the trap sump during the preflight mode 
should be investigated and implemented.  

EPS Reference #26—Keep product water removal control active during pump circulation. 

(SV3, SV4)—Preflight mode 

When operating the reactant pumps during the preflight check, excess water held up in the fuel 
cell  stack  could  collect  in  the  water  trap.  This  recommendation  proposes  keeping  the  water-
removal process active during this event to prevent any chance of overflow. Following this event, 
the recommendation in reference 25 would be implemented to eliminate all product water.  

25 

 
EPS Reference #27—Research coolant alternatives for operation in low ambient temps. 

(FC1-H2, FC1-O2, FC1-C)—Power-production mode 

When the aircraft is grounded, without power in a subfreezing environment, a water coolant could 
possibly freeze up. The TESI stack design with bordered MEAs can utilize an antifreeze mixture 
for the coolant. Other coolant alternatives should also be investigated.  

EPS Reference #28—Consider small flow to indicate regulator function. 

(FPR1, FPR2)—Standby mode 

A failure mode can occur where the pressure regulator for either the hydrogen or the oxygen gas 
supply  (FPR1  or  FPR2)  fails  closed  during  standby  mode.  Because  the  gas  lines  between  the 
pressure regulators  and the solenoid valves at the fuel cell stack (SV1 or  SV2)  will already be 
pressurized from the preflight mode, and there is no active flow of gas in standby mode, a closed 
pressure regulator would be undetectable. One way to ensure that the pressure regulator is open 
and functioning properly during standby mode would be to open the solenoid valves periodically, 
pressurizing the system and allowing the gas to flow through the pressure regulator. The problem 
with this solution is that some gas will be consumed by the fuel cell in the process, wasting reactant 
supply and generating water that will need to be cleared when the EPS is needed for power. 

EPS Reference #29—Develop a method or algorithm to test level switch. 

(LS1, LS2, LS3)—Preflight mode 

A failure mode can occur where the level switch fails set (showing that water/coolant is always 
present) or open (showing that water/coolant is not always present). This can cause a problem for 
both the water trap level switches and the coolant tank level switch. The coolant tank level switch, 
if failed set during standby, would not prompt the maintenance activity of refilling the coolant tank 
if the level is low. The water trap level switch has issues with failing set and failing open. Clearing 
all water from the water traps is a step in the preflight sequence. Proper  level switch operation 
ensures that this process does complete as planned. A method of verifying level switch function 
during preflight must be established to ensure proper function of the water traps. 

At this time, we have not determined an effective way of performing the preflight check on the 
water trap level switches. The process must be simple enough to be performed by the operators 
with little prior knowledge and user involvement but be effective at ensuring level switch success. 
Below are some options to consider: 

•  Manually fill the water trap with water. Check that the level switch is set. Trigger 

opening of the water trap solenoid. Check that the level switch opens when the water is 
completely drained. This requires system modifications to isolate the area and allow 
manual filling. 
Isolate the water trap section from the fuel cell, remove, and test separately. This requires 
system modifications to isolate. 

• 

•  Eliminate the level sensor. In other words, look for alternate methods of signaling to the 

controller that the water trap contains water and needs to be cleared. 

26 

 
EPS Reference #30—Consider redundant inlet valves. 

(SV1, SV2, FPR1, FPR2)—Standby mode 

There are multiple failure modes along the reactant path between the storage tanks and the inlet 
valves  that  result  in  the  inability of the fuel cell  stack to receive the  gasses needed  to produce 
power.  Detection  for  some  of  these  failure  modes  depends  on  the  presence  of  flow,  making 
detection difficult if not impossible. Adding a parallel reactant path with duplicate components 
would  provide  a  measure  of  redundancy  to  allow  for  successful  power  generation  when 
transitioning out of standby and into power-production mode in the event that the fuel cell inlet 
solenoid (SV1 or SV2) or pressure regulator (FPR1 or FPR2) are stuck closed. This option may be 
superior to the other solution (reference #28) in that no reactant supply is wasted but at the expense 
of an increase in the number of components, which negatively impacts weight, cost, and system 
complexity. Tests can be run on dual gas supply lines with identical components to test the concept 
with simulated failures of components and normal operation configurations. 

EPS Reference #31—Compute at what impurity level a purge is needed for the 1 hour mission 
(FC1-H2, FC1-O2)—Power-production mode. 

Because  of  the  short  duration  of  the  power-production  mode  for  the  EPS  application,  fuel  cell 
performance loss from impurity build up may not be a significant factor. With the knowledge of 
the fuel cell stack gas volume and stack current, the performance loss can be calculated over the 
mission duration. If the impact is insignificant, this application may not require a reactant purge 
process to clear the inert gas that builds up in the flow channels. The system design would still 
need to include parts and controls to perform gas purges for maintenance purposes and in the event 
that stack performance is impacted by other degradation mechanisms. The control algorithm could 
be simplified if purges are not required. 

EPS Reference #32—Consider a check valve to prevent backflow. 

(SV3, SV5, SV6)—Standby mode 

If SV3 or SV5 fail fully open, air can flow into the anode flow channels of the fuel cell stack if a 
check  valve  is  not  present.  The  air  would  then  react  with  hydrogen  entering  the  anode  flow 
channels  upon  the  next  pressurization  of  the  stack  during  operation  or  preflight,  creating  a 
dangerous  mixture  and  damaging  the  catalyst  in  the  fuel  cell  stack.  Inserting  a  check  valve 
upstream of the solenoid valves would eliminate this problem and require the failure of two parts 
to create the issue instead of one part. Inserting a check valve would not influence system operation 
as it currently stands. 

EPS Reference #33—Consider air-flow sensor. 

(HTX1)—Preflight mode 

As the system design currently stands, there is no provision for checking the successful operation 
of the fan on the heat exchanger during preflight mode. The fan is needed during power-production 
mode to remove the heat generated by the fuel cell stack when it is providing power. Without the 
fan, the fuel cell stack would overheat and be irreparably damaged. Adding an air flow sensor to 

27 

 
the heat exchanger would be a simple solution to performing a preflight check on the fan. Any 
issues resulting in a lack of airflow or reduced air flow could be identified, diagnosed, and fixed 
on the ground. 

EPS Reference #34—Consider redundant PTs on reactant storage tanks. 

(PT1, PT2)—All modes 

Diagnosing a faulty pressure transducer when the signal fails to full scale or to zero scale is rather 
simple. Signal drift by a pressure transducer is a more probable failure mode that is much more 
difficult  to  diagnose.  The  pressure  transducers  used  for  monitoring  reactant  storage  pressure  
(PT1  and  PT2)  are  critical  for  the  EPS  application  because  they  are  the  primary  method  of 
calculating  system  run  time,  which  the  operator  needs  to  know  at  all  times.  Any  drift  in  these 
sensors  would  provide  incorrect  information  to  the  operator,  which  could  result  in  poor  
decision-making during an emergency flight situation. Installing a second pressure transducer on 
the  reactant  tank  would  provide  an  additional  verification  of  reactant  supply  without  much 
additional cost or complexity. 

EPS Reference #35—Develop a backup thermal control scheme using T4. 

(T3)—All modes 

The control algorithm as it currently exists uses T3 to control the fuel cell temperature. T4 can be 
used as a backup in case T3 is not working at all or providing incorrect information because it also 
provides useful information about the stack temperature. The control algorithm should be updated 
to use T4 in the event that T3 is no longer sufficient. 

EPS Reference #36—Develop an algorithm to compute the remaining run time because of a slow 
loss of reactant. 

(RV3, RV4)—Power production and standby modes 

If a leak at a relief valve (RV3, RV4) or any other location occurs, then the tank pressure will no 
longer be a direct indicator of EPS run time. An algorithm can be developed that takes into account 
a detected leak rate when computing EPS run time. In standby mode, detecting a slow and steady 
loss in pressure will signal a leak, and the effect on run time can be easily computed by subtracting 
the projected amount of hydrogen lost during operation from the existing hydrogen in the storage 
tank. In power-production mode, a constant pressure decay rate exists for the system based on the 
stack  power  level.  If  the  pressure  decay  rate  is  higher  than  the  known  value,  then  a  leak  is 
suspected. An adjusted remaining run time can be calculated based on the tank pressure, known 
stack  consumption  rate,  and  calculated  leak  rate  with  an  algorithm  similar  to  that  used  during 
standby mode. 

EPS Reference #37—Investigate the potential severity of a high-pressure O2 leak. 

(V2)—Power-production and standby modes 

28 

 
An external  gas  leak from the oxygen storage tank  could  produce  a small  jet  of oxygen  in the 
energy  system  compartment.  It  is  unclear  what  the  severity  of  this  failure  would  be  in  that 
environment.  High-purity  oxygen  can  be  highly  reactive  with  certain  materials.  The  level  of 
severity would also be dependent on the system configuration inside the compartment. This threat 
should be evaluated in more detail once the system is more specifically defined. 

EPS Reference #38—Periodic RV check is only means to detect failed closed condition. 

(RV1, RV2, RV3, RV4)—Preflight mode 

Storage and fuel cell system relief valves must be checked for functionality and accuracy as part 
of the periodic maintenance schedule. The failed closed occurrence is very rare and there is no 
effect as a single point failure. However as part of a multipoint failure, the effect could lead to total 
failure.  

4.2  RECOMMENDATIONS—MPS 

MPS Reference #1—Consider adding filter downstream of reactant pump.  

(M1, M2)—Power-production mode 

A failure mode can occur where the reactant pumps (M1 or M2) fail and produce contaminants 
that can then enter the FC stack. Adding a filter downstream of the reactant pumps will protect the 
FC stack from these contaminants. An additional filter should be considered at the exit of the FC 
reactant lines to protect the solenoid valves and reactant pumps from particles that could exit the 
FC stack, such as carbon fibers from the GDLs. 

MPS Reference #2—Consider second PT to indicate adequate flow as indicated by pressure drop 
(M1, M2)—Power production and startup mode. 

A failure can occur where the reactant pump(s) stop operating and the fuel cell performance decays 
because of flooding. Adding pressure transducers at the FC reactant outlet lines allows the system 
to monitor differential pressure across the FC to ensure adequate velocity to remove product water. 
These additional pressure transducers also give redundancy for the existing ones. A second option 
is to measure reactant pump electrical current draw to indicate pump RPM, which relates to flow. 

MPS Reference #3—Include a monitor for current draw on reactant recirculation pump. 

(M1, M2)—Power-production and startup mode 

See reference #2 above 

MPS Reference #4—Include a thermal switch on V3 for redundancy.  

(HT1)—Power-production and startup mode 

Currently,  there  is  not  a  temperature  sensor  in  the  coolant  tank  where  the  coolant  heaters  are 
located. The temperature sensor at the fuel cell coolant inlet controls the coolant heater. An over 

29 

 
temperature thermal switch will provide an additional safety factor to ensure the coolant tank never 
overheats. 

MPS  Reference  #5—Need  redundant  pressure  indicator  for  reactant;  consider  second  PT  at 
reactant FC outlet. 

(PT3, PT4)—All Modes 

Diagnosing a faulty pressure transducer when the signal fails to full scale or to zero scale is rather 
simple. Signal drift by a pressure transducer is a more probable failure mode that is much more 
difficult  to  diagnose.  The  pressure  transducers  used  for  monitoring  reactant  pressure  (PT3  and 
PT4)  are  critical  for  the  MPS  application.  Any  drift  in  these  sensors  would  provide  incorrect 
information to the system control, which could result in inappropriate shutdown. Installing a 2nd 
pressure transducer on each FC outlet would provide an additional verification of reactant supply 
without much additional cost or complexity. 

MPS Reference #6—Investigate detection methods for external H2 leak.  

(M1, WT1, FC1-H2)—Power-production and startup mode 

A  failure  can  occur  if  a  hydrogen  leak  develops  that  increases  the  environmental  hydrogen 
concentration to a dangerous level and ignites. A hydrogen-detection method will provide valuable 
information. A continuous flow of atmospheric air would purge the space around the FC system 
and a hydrogen detector placed where the flow exits (ideally at the top of the space). Testing may 
be necessary to ensure a COTS hydrogen detector will work effectively at the temperatures the 
system will be exposed to. 

MPS Reference #7—Compute total product water available for worst case flooding risk.  

(WT1, WT2)—Power-production mode 

The failure of the product water trap in either the hydrogen or oxygen recirculation circuits could 
allow the direct release of product water from the traps and cause flooding external into system 
enclosure. The worst-case level of flooding is determined by the amount of reactants available to 
produce water. The short mission of this application limits the amount of onboard reactants. The 
mass of onboard reactants total about 17 kg, which could produce 17 liters of water. This volume 
is slightly less than 3% of the total volume of the EPS PEMFC system enclosure. Although this 
volume is small, the location of components in the overall system design should be addressed to 
prevent flooding of sensitive components.  

MPS Reference #8—Describe control to limit product water accumulation based on amp-hr count 
and its use as a secondary control/alarm.  

(LS1, LS2)—Power-production and startup mode 

The failure of the level switch on either the hydrogen or oxygen water trap could lead to the drain 
valve not being actuated and the water trap overflowing. This would lead to excess water in the 
reactant  recirculation  circuit  and  flood  of  the  fuel  cell  stack.  TESI  uses  a  control  algorithm  to 

30 

 
compute product water production. Fuel cell amperage is directly proportional to the consumption 
rate of the hydrogen, oxygen reactants, and the production rate of product water. The controller 
stores accumulated fuel cell amperage over time and determines when to open the drain valve. The 
drain event is allotted a certain amount of time. If the level switch does not reset after this event, 
normally  an  alarm  will  trigger  a  shutdown  due  to  a  defective  level  switch.  However,  for  this 
application,  the  control  algorithm  should  continue  to  run  to  extend  the  run  time  for  as  long  as 
possible.  

MPS Reference #9—Describe how heater should be sized for system heat loss and how to size 
HTX1 for additional HT1 heat load.  

(HT1)—Power-production and startup mode 

The coolant heater for this application is the standard bootstrap heater used during system startup. 
The heater is powered by the FC providing a sizable electrical load for the system and adding that 
electrical  load  as  supplemental  heat  directly  to  the  coolant  for  quick  startup.  After  reaching 
operating temperature, the heater is turned off. In the event of a heater failing to turn off, the liquid-
to-air heat exchanger for the system must be sized to remove the process heat at expected max load 
plus the heat supplied by the failed coolant heater. 

MPS Reference #10—Describe how to size RV3/RV4 for full high-pressure storage flow. 

(FPR1, FPR2)—Power-production and startup modes 

Relief valves RV3 and RV4 protect the FC system from potential high-pressure exposure because 
of the failure of either of the forward pressure regulators, FPR1 or FPR2. These relief valves must 
be sized large enough to prevent excessive pressure buildup at the inlets of the isolation solenoid 
valves SV1 or SV2. If fully opened when the failed flow condition of the selected FPRs is not 
restricted enough, a flow-restriction orifice may need to be added downstream of the each FPR. 

MPS Reference #11—Consider sizing orifice restriction to allow low-pressure operation. 

(SV3, SV4, SV5 & SV6)—Power-production mode 

If any of the vent or drain valves downstream of the fuel stack fail open, there will be a large loss 
of reactants out of those vents. The use of flow-control orifices at all gas outlets will minimize the 
loss of reactants and allow longer run time than without the orifice. These orifices can be sized to 
limit  flow  to  the  sonic,  choked  flow  condition  when  the  pressure  drop  to  the  environment  is 
sufficiently high, such as at higher altitudes. 

MPS Reference #12—Develop an algorithm to indicate adequate coolant volume based on coolant 
flow and stack temp.  

(LS3)—All modes 

For this critical application, the system should continue to operate if a failed coolant level switch 
indicates low coolant. An alternate method of monitoring adequate coolant flow volume can be 
developed  based  on  the  inlet  and  outlet  stack-coolant  temperature  difference.  The  monitor  can 

31 

 
consider the fuel cell output and the temperature difference to estimate the thermal capacitance 
and resulting coolant flow. 

MPS Reference #13—Examine risk of continued operation during slow reactant leak—look at H2 
concentration time response. 

(RV1, RV2, M1, M2, WT1, FC1-H2 &O2) —Power-production and startup modes 

The risk associated with a slow external hydrogen leak is both a safety and a shortened run-time 
risk. Monitoring storage pressure will provide an indication of the level of the leak. The hydrogen 
leak  detector  provides  an  ambient  H2  concentration  reading  shutting  down  the  FC  system  and 
venting the H2 storage at the 50% low-explosion level (LEL) set point. The time to reach a 25% 
LEL warning and the 50% LEL shutdown depends on the size of the leak, volume of the cabin, 
and the cabin ventilation rate, which is based on the FAA ventilation-per-occupant requirement. 
The aircraft used in this medevac application allowed a warning (25% LEL) time of 8 minutes and 
then equilibrated and remained at the shutdown level (50% LEL) after 50 minutes with a hydrogen 
leak of 57 standard liters per minute.  

MPS Reference #14—Investigate method to detect an H2 leak into coolant. 

(FC1-H2)—Power-production and startup modes 

The interface material between the reactant cavities and the coolant cavities within the TESI fuel 
cell stack is solid, nonporous graphite. Any possible leakage of hydrogen into the coolant would 
potentially come from the sealing surfaces between the manifolds of the stack. The present coolant 
system is not a tightly sealed configuration. A large leak would be detected as a loss of reactant 
test pressure during the maintenance check but would not be detected during operation. Small leaks 
would not be detected as reactant pressure changes. A sealed coolant system could be considered 
as a means to detect a pressure change due to reactant leakage into the coolant.  

MPS Reference #15—Investigate method to detect an O2 leak into coolant. 

(FC1-O2)—Power-production and startup modes 

See reference #14. The larger oxygen molecule is less likely to leak into the coolant; however, a 
sealed coolant system could be considered. 

MPS Reference #16—Compute purge frequency and quantity versus reactant impurity level. 

(FC1-H2, FC1-O2)—Power-production mode 

Because of the relatively short duration of the power-production mode for the MPS application, 
fuel  cell  performance  loss  from  impurity  buildup  may  not  be  a  significant  factor.  With  the 
knowledge  of  the  fuel  cell  stack  gas  volume  and  stack  current,  the  performance  loss  can  be 
calculated over the mission duration. If the impact is insignificant, this application may not require 
a reactant purge process to clear the inert gas that builds up in the flow channels. The system design 
would still need to include parts and controls to perform gas purges for maintenance purposes and 

32 

 
in the event  that stack performance is impacted  by other degradation mechanisms.  The  control 
algorithm could be simplified if purges are not required. 

MPS Reference #17—Develop a backup thermal control scheme using T2. 

(T1)—Power-production and startup modes 

The control algorithm as it currently exists uses T1 to control the fuel cell temperature. T2 can be 
used as a backup in case T1 is not working at all or providing incorrect information because it also 
provides useful information about the stack temperature. The control algorithm should be updated 
to use T2 in the event that T1 is no longer effective. 

MPS Reference #18—Periodic RV check is only means to detect failed closed condition. 

(RV1, RV2, RV3, RV4)—All modes 

Storage and fuel cell system relief valves must be checked for functionality and accuracy as part 
of the periodic maintenance schedule. The failed closed occurrence is very rare, and there is no 
effect as a single point failure. However, as part of a multipoint failure, the effect could lead to 
total failure.  

MPS Reference #19—Appropriate procedures for handling high-pressure reactant tanks must be 
in place.  

(V1, V2)—All modes 

The  reactant  tanks  are  high-pressure  tanks,  5000  psig  H2  and  3000  psig  O2,  fitted  with  high-
pressure  fittings  and  instrumentation.  Filled  reactant  tanks,  both  hydrogen  and  oxygen,  will  be 
installed separately from the system installation for the initial reactant charge and then removed 
and replaced with filled tanks when the system is recharged. Handling and connecting these tanks 
separate  from  the  system  requires  that  the  appropriate  procedures  and  practices  be  in  place  to 
prevent equipment damage or personnel injury. 

MPS Reference #20—Check accuracy of PGs at 200-hr maintenance interval. 

(PT1, PT2, PG1, PG2)—All modes 

The  pressure  transducers  used  for  monitoring  reactant  storage  pressure  (PT1  and  PT2)  are  the 
primary method of calculating system run time, which the operator needs to know at all times. 
Diagnosing a faulty pressure transducer when the signal fails to full scale or to zero scale is rather 
simple. Signal drift by a pressure transducer is a more probable failure mode that is much more 
difficult to diagnose. Each reactant tank has a pressure gauge installed as a redundant pressure 
indicator. The accuracy of these gauges should be checked at the regular maintenance interval to 
insure a true reference. 

MPS Reference #21—Consider a control override to allow a cold start without heater load. 

(HT1)—Startup mode 

33 

 
The system is designed to provide a quick heat-up start using the bootstrap heater as a load before 
applying the external load. Failure of the bootstrap heater should not prevent system startup. The 
system controls should allow an override to permit an external load to be manually applied for a 
cold startup. The override would include provisions to limit load current until the FC stack has 
reached operating temperature.  

MPS Reference #22—Consider a timeout for not completing shutdown. 

(All SVs, MV1, MV3, PT3, PT4)—Shutdown mode 

The  shutdown  mode  removes  all  reactants.  This  involves  a  process  for  consuming  reactants  to 
create a vacuum in the stack. During the process, the reactant valves sequence on and off, and the 
pressure transducers remain active to maintain the correct stoichiometric ratio while the reactants 
are being consumed. The pressure in the stack decreases while staying within the allowable anode 
to  cathode  pressure  difference.  Failure  of  one  of  the  active  components  to  provide  the  correct 
control  during  the  process  could  result  in  the  process  being  held  up  in  part  of  the  sequence 
indefinitely.  A  timeout  alarm  should  be  considered  if  the  shutdown  process  has  exceeded  a 
specified time limit, indicating a potential component failure. 

MPS Reference #23—Consider burp test for vent SVs at startup after pressure test. 

(SV5, SV6)—Startup mode 

Vent valves SV5 and SV6 are used during the power-production mode to purge the inert gases that 
have built up and during shutdown to depressurize the system to begin the vacuum process. This 
recommendation suggests a simple test of these valves during the startup mode to check that they 
are functional. Following the static leakdown test, each valve can be quickly opened and closed. 
The corresponding reactant pressure is monitored for an acceptable pressure decay indicating a 
functional solenoid valve.  

MPS Reference #24—Consider manual override to check fan operation. 

(HTX1)—Startup mode 

The liquid-to-air heat exchanger uses an axial fan to move air across tubes for rejecting processed 
heat to the ambient air. Without the fan, the output of the FC system would be limited. A simple 
functional check of the fan is suggested by using a manual override to activate the fan with the 
operator physically observing the air flow. 

MPS Reference #25—Consider redundant H2 leak detector. 

(A1)—All modes 

The  hydrogen  leak  detector  is  interlocked  with  the  FC  system,  preventing  FC  operation  in  the 
absence of an H2 concentration reading from the detector. The detection system is subject to drift 
in the accuracy of the H2 concentration. The calibration must be checked and verified at regular 
intervals. If the accuracy drifts high, reading higher than the actual concentration, the safety risk 
to the aircraft is not affected, and only the operational risk will be impacted. The safety risk is a 

34 

 
concern if the accuracy drifts lower, and the actual H2 concentration is higher than detected. The 
design should consider an additional hydrogen leak-detection device to address this issue.  

MPS  Reference  #26—Describe  control  to  limit  reactant  loss  based  on  amp  hr  count  and  as  a 
secondary control/alarm.  

(LS1, LS2)—Power-production mode 

The failure of the level switch to reset on either the hydrogen or oxygen water trap could lead to 
the drain valve remaining open. This would lead to continuous loss of reactant. TESI uses a control 
algorithm  described  in  Reference  #8  to  compute  product  water  production.  A  similar  timing 
algorithm can be used as a secondary control to prevent the complete loss of reactant. 

MPS Reference #27—Develop a response to a detectable H2 tank gas leak; consider an emergency 
storage tank dump.  

(V1)—All modes 

A rapid increase in the measured H2 concentration is an indication of a major leak in the H2 tank 
or  supply.  This  may  be  greater  than  the  allowable  leak  that  the  aircraft  ventilation  can  safely 
handle. The H2 supply should consider a separate valve that can be operated to allow an emergency 
dump to avoid reaching a hazardous concentration level in the aircraft. 

MPS Reference #28—Develop a response to a detectable O2 tank gas leak; consider an emergency 
storage tank dump.  

(V2)—All modes 

An external gas leak from the oxygen storage tank could produce a small jet of oxygen into the 
cabin. It is unclear what the severity of this failure would be. High-purity oxygen can be highly 
reactive  with  certain  materials.  The  level  of  severity  would  also  be  dependent  on  the  system 
configuration  inside  the  compartment.  This  threat  should  be  evaluated  in  more  detail  once  the 
system is more specifically defined. 

MPS  Reference  #29—Discuss  combining  separation  and  water-storage  functions  to  simplify 
product water management. 

(V4)—Startup and power-production modes 

The  water  produced  by  the  reaction  of  the  H2  and  O2  is  to  be  collected  and  held  onboard  the 
aircraft. The system has active level switches and drain valves. This recommendation proposes 
considering  a  design  that  would  eliminate  the  level  switches  and  valves  and  allow  the  product 
water to drain directly into separate pressurized tanks. The majority of product water is contained 
on the cathode side of the system. The cathode tank would be sized for the total product water 
quantity, and the anode tank would be sized much smaller.  

MPS Reference #30—Discuss H2 vent location—aft of engine intake.  

35 

 
(RV1, FPR1)—All modes 

A high-pressure hydrogen release from either of the two H2 relief valves could result in the release 
of large volumes of hydrogen. The hydrogen must be vented to the exterior. There is concern about 
releasing this large volume into an engine intake. To avoid this, the H2 vent lines from the system 
relief valves are to be routed behind the aircraft engines.  

MPS Reference #31—Discuss high-pressure O2 release through luggage compartment hatch. 

(RV1, FPR1)—All modes 

A high-pressure oxygen release from either of the two H2 relief valves could result in the release 
of large volumes of oxygen. Large volumes of oxygen must be vented to the exterior. To minimize 
vent line penetrations through the aircraft fuselage, the high-pressure vent lines from the O2 relief 
valves are to be routed through the luggage compartment hatch.  

MPS Reference #32—Discuss methods to detect/contain overflow.  

(V4)—Startup and power-production modes 

In this application, the water produced by the PEMFC is captured in the product water tank. The 
mass of onboard reactants totals approximately 17 kg, which could produce 17 liters of water. In 
the event of a leaking product water tank, it is recommended that a method of containing a leak be 
implemented or a method of detecting a leak be used to provide an alarm for operator action. A 
secondary overflow pan or basin could be used and could include a water leak sensor. 

MPS Reference #33—Discuss the requirement for a stack pressurization timeout.  

(RV3, RV4, SV1, SV2, MV1, MV2, FPR1, FPR2)—Startup mode 

The startup mode provides a controlled process to pressurize the FC stack. During the process, the 
reactant valves sequence on and off and the pressure transducers remain active to maintain the 
allowable  anode  to  cathode  pressure  difference  while  the  reactants  are  pressurizing  the  stack. 
Failure of one of the active components to provide the correct control during the process could 
result in the process being held up in part of the sequence indefinitely. A timeout alarm should be 
considered  if  the  startup  process  has  exceeded  a  specified  time  limit  indicating  a  potential 
component failure. 

MPS Reference #34—Explain FS1 as an alarm indicator, not a shutdown control.  

(FS1)—Startup mode 

The loss of coolant flow will result in the FC overheating and shutting down at a high temperature. 
Flow switch FS1 is an alarm indicator for this condition but is not used as a shutdown control. 
Monitoring the FC stack temperature provides an indication of sufficient coolant flow for near-
term operation. 

MPS Reference #35—Explain that the vacuum condition should be maintained until startup. 

36 

 
(WT1, WT2, FC1-H2, FC1-O2)—Startup mode 

When the PEMFC system is shutdown, the inlet and vent valves go to normally closed positions. 
System pressure is released through the water trap drain valves to drain the trap sumps. A small 
resistive load is applied to the FC stack to cause consumption of the remaining reactants trapped 
in the stack. The inlet valves are cycled open and closed to maintain the minimum allowable delta 
pressure within the stack until a vacuum state is reached. Once the shutdown process is complete, 
manual valves MV1, MV2, MV3, and MV4 are closed. 

The PEMFC should remain in the vacuum state until it is restarted. If there is no longer a vacuum 
on either gas circuit, the system should be pressure checked for leaks. Atmospheric air that has 
bled back into the FC stack indicates a potential leak. This is especially a concern on the anode, 
the hydrogen side of the stack.  

MPS Reference #36—H2 leak detector calibration must be constantly checked. 

(A1)—All modes 

See Reference #25 above. 

MPS Reference #37—Include a visual level indicator. 

(LS3, V4)—Startup and shutdown modes 

It is recommended that a simple, visual level indicator be included on both the coolant tank and 
the product water tank. At startup, the coolant tank should be checked for a fully filled condition 
and  the  product  water  tank  for  empty.  When  the  system  is  shutdown,  the  visual  indicator  will 
confirm that the product water tank has been emptied.  

MPS Reference #38—Recommend cell voltage check at full load. 

(RV3, RV4, SV1, SV2, MV1, MV2, MV3, MV4)—Startup mode 

The  startup  procedure  includes  a  check  of  individual  cell  voltages  at  an  open  circuit,  no  load 
condition.  This  verifies  that  all  the  cells  are  receiving  reactant  and  are  responding.  It  is 
recommended that a check of individual cell voltages also be checked at full load to verify expected 
cell  performance.  Acceptable  cell  performance  will  maintain  minimum  allowable  cell  voltage 
differences  between adjacent  cells. An unacceptable individual cell  voltage  is  cause for  further 
evaluation. 

5.  TESTING 

5.1  PURPOSE 

The FMEA analysis relies on making certain assumptions for modes of operation outside what is 
normally  experienced.  The  analysis  requires  the  use  of  engineering  judgement  based  on  basic 
engineering or scientific principles. Acceptance testing of fuel cell system products is typically 
done  under  very  controlled  conditions.  Warning  alarms  and  shutdowns  prevent  operational 

37 

 
parameters to stray outside, beyond allowable ranges. The purpose of the FMEA-related testing is 
to  validate  some  of  the  assumptions  that  lead  to  high  RPNs  and  potential  failure  modes.  This, 
however,  requires  test  procedures  that  push  the  operational  parameters  beyond  the  acceptable 
range. 

A list of prospective tests is shown in table 10. These tests were selected to support some of the 
assumptions used in the studies and some of the results from each of the two FMEAs. Each test 
listing shows the failed component P&ID reference number in the last column.

5.2  TESTING 

The test procedures were designed to simulate the out-of-range condition for the subject failure 
mode. The tests focused on the effect of the failure on fuel cell stack operation. The test procedures 
directed the operation of the fuel cell stacks under conditions that would be imposed by a specific 
system component failure. 

Testing was completed for 14 of the 17 tests proposed in table 10. Twelve of these tests used four 
cell short stacks running on an in-house TESI Medusa fuel cell test station for system simulation. 
These  are  open,  flow-through  test  systems.  The  test  procedures  were  designed  to  simulate  the 
closed-system  operation  of  the  aircraft systems. The three tests not run were the Coolant Flow 
MPS Test #5 and the Backup Thermal Control Tests EPS #8 and MPS #7. These three tests require 
standalone control systems with extensive reprogramming capability, which was not available at 

38 

 
the time. The Fuel Cell Stack Evacuation EPS Test #9 and the Cold Startup MPS Test #8 were 
performed on a 64-cell stack to test the effect on a full-size stack. To minimize irreversible damage 
to the fuel cell test articles, the tests were prioritized in order of expected severity. 

The membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) in all 14 of the original tests used carbon-supported 
platinum catalyst on the anode. This is a less-expensive option than an anode with a pure platinum 
black catalyst. Poor performance with this catalyst, when running with inert contaminated reactant 
in  the  anode,  terminated  the  completion  of  several  runs  of  the  EPS  Test  #7  and  MPS  Test  #6 
Reactant Impurity Tests. These tests were later rerun with a 2-cell stack using a platinum black 
anode catalyst.  

5.3  TEST PROCEDURES AND RESULTS 

Several of the tests proposed in table 10 are similar for the two applications. This reduces the actual 
number of test procedures performed, although the results have different consequences depending 
on the application. Each test procedure is presented in appendix I, followed by charted results and 
the significance for each application. 

To  have  enough  data  for  the  results  to  be  meaningful,  the  test  procedure  may  have  required 
multiple runs of the test at different conditions. The testing sequence for multiple runs started with 
a less-severe condition and progressed in severity to determine an effect or a threshold.  

Tests of the stack were run at baseline conditions after each test. Baseline polarization data were 
used to determine any performance degradation.  

5.4  OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 

Despite the deliberate abuse that the initial 4-cell stack endured over the 4-month period of testing, 
the  unit  did  not  fail  or  even  lose  any  of  its  initial  performance.  All  of  the  post-test,  baseline 
polarization tests run during this period showed a consistently close data grouping. The baseline 
polarization data curves are shown in figure 7. The lower curves represent the first tests on the 
newly assembled stack. As expected, the performance improved during the first several tests as 
the cells were broken in and fully activated. Throughout the testing, the polarization curves tightly 
indicated  very  little  change  in  performance.  As  the  tests  grew  increasingly  more  severe  with 
freezing temperature extremes and high-temperature operation, performance was not degraded.  

39 

 
Figure 7. Baseline Polarization Curves 

The results validate the assumptions used in the FMEA analysis. They indicate that the fuel cell 
stack  can  operate  well  beyond  the  alarm  limits  presently  imposed  by  the  supporting  system.  It 
should be noted that these tests represent the duration of operation of the fuel cell stack based on 
the aircraft applications selected for this study. Longer operation at off-limit conditions would very 
likely produce different results.

APPENDIX I—TEST RESULTS 

EPS Test #2—Pressure Difference 
EPS Test #6—Pressure Difference 
MPS Test #4—Pressure Difference 

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—This test simulates a pressure difference between anode and cathode 

caused by loss of reactant upstream or one reactant continually venting through an 
open downstream vent valve.  

•  Shutdown/failure criteria—A pressure difference shutdown will be ignored and the 

pressure allowed to drop until an individual cell voltage drops below a 0.6 Vdc level. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—4-cell stack 2.8x4.2-081 
•  Test station—4-cell capable Medusa for 150A, 4 Vdc load 

•  Temp/pressure—70°C, 30 psig with H2 or O2 dropping to 0 pisg  
•  Reactants—fully humidified, 100% H2 and O2 
•  Reactant flows 

•  H2 = 2.0 SLM (0.0112 SLM/Amp/cell no.) 
•  O2 = 1.68 SLM (0.0093 SLM/Amp/cell no.) 

•  Load—constant 145W 

3.  Baseline test 

•  70°C, 30 psig, 100% H2 and O2 

•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  2 separate 1-hour tests with one reactant dropping in 1 psid increments with a  

2-minute hold at each increment

Figure I-2—Pressure Difference Test B 

Remarks 

The system pressure difference signal is typically set to alarm at 5 psid. These data show that 
the stack will continue to run long after the pressure difference alarm is activated, regardless of 
lower anode (H

) or cathode (O

) pressure.  

₂

₂

Note that in Test B, the test station has some difficulty controlling current to maintain constant 
power as the cell voltage drops. This is believed to be due to the accuracy and tolerance level in 
the current control and oxygen mass flow controller.  

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions after each test did not show any degradation 
in stack performance.

EPS Test #1—Reactant Recirculation 
MPS Test #1—Reactant Recirculation 

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—A series of tests will be run to simulate a reactant flow rate decay in either 
the anode or cathode recirculating circuit. Separate tests will be run with reduced 
recirculation for the anode and the cathode.   

•  Shutdown/failure criteria—An individual test will be run for 1 hour or until individual 

cell voltage drops below a 0.6 Vdc level. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—cell stack 2.8x4.2-081  

•  Test station—4-cell capable Medusa for 150A, 4 Vdc load 
•  Temp/pressure—70°C, 30 psig with H2 and O2.  

•  Reactants—fully humidified, 100% H2 and O2 
•  Reactant flows 

•  H2 = 2.0 SLM, stoic = 1.5 (0.0112 SLM/Amp/cell no.) dropping to 1.35 SLM, 

stoic = 1 (0.00748 SLM/Amp/cell) 

•  O2 = 1.68 SLM, stoic = 2.5 (0.00935 SLM/Amp/cell no.) dropping to near 

0.673 SLM, stoic = 1 (0.00374 SLM/Amp/cell) 

•  Load—constant 45A (600mA/cm2) 

3.  Baseline test 

•  70°C, 30 psig, H2 stoic = 1.5, and O2 stoic = 2.5 
•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  2 separate groups of tests. One group with variable H2 flows for the anode and 

constant cathode flow. The other group with variable O2 flows for the cathode and 
constant anode flow. Each test will be run at the given flows for 1 hour or until an 
individual cell voltage drops below 0.6 Vdc. 

•  Following each test, the stack will be run at baseline conditions until the performance 

recorded during the initial baseline test returns. 

•  Variable H2 flow tests 

A.  H2 = 1.62 SLM, stoic = 1.20, O2 = 1.68 SLM, stoic = 2.50  

B.  H2 = 1.49 SLM, stoic = 1.10, O2 = 1.68 SLM, stoic = 2.50  

C.  H2 = 1.42 SLM, stoic = 1.05, O2 = 1.68 SLM, stoic = 2.50  

•  Variable O2 flow tests 

D.  H2 = 2.03 SLM, stoic = 1.50, O2 = 1.08 SLM, stoic = 1.60  

E.  H2 = 2.03 SLM, stoic = 1.50, O2 = 0.94 SLM, stoic = 1.40

Remarks 

₂

Although the magnitude of the cell voltage drop is similar for both the anode (H
(O
), the rate of the drop is the opposite of what is expected. Also, it was expected that the 
anode would be able to run with a stoichiometric ratio lower than 1.1. These results are probably 
due to the anode catalyst being a lightly loaded carbon-supported material that does not 
perform as well as the cathode, which is a pure platinum black material. The question now 
becomes how would the stack perform under similar conditions with a platinum black catalyst on 
both electrodes.  

) and cathode 

₂

Note that in Tests D, E, and F, the periodic drop in cell voltage is due to a periodic drop in 
cathode pressure when a water trap on the oxygen side of the system is momentarily opened to 
vent product water.  

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions after each test did not show any degradation 
in stack performance.

EPS Test #7—Reactant Impurity  
MPS Test #6—Reactant Impurity  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The goal is to verify the reactant purge algorithm developed for 

maintaining fuel cell stack performance. The test will look at the decline of individual 
cell voltages as inert gases build up in the reactants.  

•  Shutdown/test criteria—Testing the stack on an open system does not allow the 
inerts to naturally build up. Several reactant mixes with increasing inert gas 
concentrations will be tested to provide data for predicting cell voltage degradation 
versus inert gas concentration. Reactant stoics will be held constant, and the total 
fuel flow will be increased to compensate for the increase in inert N2. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—4-cell stack 2.8x4.2-081 
•  Test station—4-cell capable Medusa for 150A, 4 Vdc load 

•  Temp/pressure—70°C, 45 psia 
•  Reactants—fully humidified 

• 100% H2 and O2 for baseline 

• 10%, 30% and 50% N2 in H2 for anode degradation 
• 10%, 30% and 50% N2 in O2 for cathode degradation 

•  Reactant flows—up 2.0 SLM H2 & 1.68 O2 for baseline, greater with inert 

contaminated reactants 
•  Load—constant 145W

inert concentration or low stoichiometric flow. 

Remarks 

The inert nitrogen content in the reactants was deliberately chosen to be much higher than even 
the worst-case scenarios. The effect on performance from increased inert concentration and 
reduced stoichiometric content can be seen when comparing one chart to the next.  

The test station had difficulty controlling current to maintain constant power as the cell voltage 
dropped. Also the periodic drop in cell voltage due to a periodic drop in cathode pressure is 

I-14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
present in some of the data. The periodic drop in cathode pressure occurs when the water trap 
on the oxygen side of the system is momentarily opened to vent product water.

MPS Test #3 – Excess Product Water  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The objective of this test will be to validate the amp-hour method for 

determining liquid water levels in the water-management system.  

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—4-cell stack 2.8x4.2-081 
•  Test station—4-cell capable Medusa for 150A, 4 Vdc load 

•  Temp/pressure—70°C, 30 psig with H2 and O2.  
•  Reactants—100% H2 and O2, fully humidified 
•  Reactant flows 

•  H2 stoic = 1.5  
•  O2 stoic = 2.5 

•  Load—constant 600mA/cm2 

3.  Baseline test 

•  70°C, 30 psig, H2 stoic = 1.5, and O2 stoic = 2.5 

•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  Run at baseline conditions for 5 hours, collecting and measuring anode and cathode 

product water volume every hour. 

5.  Data requirements 

•  Standard output available from the Medusa test station  

I-16 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure I-13—Excess Product Water Test MPS 

Remarks 

The calculated value for the total accumulated amount of water produced by the fuel cell 
reaction is represented by the dash line. The water volumes collected during the 5-hour test 
closely match the computed values. 

Note that the calculated volume is for the total product water volume. The accumulation of 
product water occurs largely on the cathode side of the cell. The sizing, drain sequence, and 
alarm conditions for both traps are all based on total accumulation in the cathode trap. 

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions before and after each test did not show any 
degradation in stack performance.

MPS Test #8—Cold Startup  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The MPS uses a coolant heater (HT1) as a bootstrap load for accelerating 
the warmup period when starting the system. The purpose of this test is to determine 
the warmup temperature rise rate in the absence of the bootstrap heater.  

•  Test criteria—The test will be run until an operating temperature of 60°C is reached 

but no longer than 2 hours. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—64-cell stack 2.8x4.2-082 with integrated BOP on TESI test cart 
•  Temp/pressure—room temperature, ambient pressure 

•  Reactants—100% H2 and O2 at 15 psig 
•  Load—constant 1 kW 

3.  Testing sequence 

•  System starts at test conditions and operates until operating temperature is achieved  

4.  Data requirements

Figure I-14—Cold Startup Test 

I-18 

 
 
 
 
 
Remarks 

The test was run on a full-size fuel cell system. This included a 64-cell stack with an integrated 
balance of plant and a coolant system designed for the appropriate thermal control. The total 
thermal capacitance includes all of the components plus the coolant. 

Running with constant 1 kW load, the system took 50 minutes to reach a 63ºC coolant outlet, 
using only the inefficiency of the stack. This test shows the need and benefit of using the output 
power to input additional heat through a bootstrap heater to accelerate system warmup.  

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions before and after each test did not show any 
degradation in stack performance.  

I-19 

 
 
 
 
 
EPS Test #9—Fuel Cell Stack Evacuation  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The EPS fuel cell stack is evacuated as part of the pre-flight check and 
remains at low vacuum while in the standby condition, which ideally (unless an 
emergency would occur) would be until the next schedule pre-flight check. This will 
determine the length of time the EPS stack can maintain the evacuated state. 
•  Test criteria—The test will be run for a maximum of 24 hours or until the stack 

pressure reaches ambient pressure. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test article—64-cell stack 2.8x4.2-082 with integrated BOP on TESI test cart 

•  Temp/pressure—room temperature, ambient pressure  

3.  Testing sequence 

•  System is run and then shutdown with the residual reactants consumed to create a 
vacuum. The system is then isolated and the system’s pressure is monitored for the 
stack pressure versus time response.  

4.  Data requirements 

•  Standard pressure outputs available from the TESI test cart  

Figure I-15—Fuel Cell Stack Evacuation Test 

I-20 

 
 
 
 
 
Remarks 

The test was run on a 64-cell stack with an integrated balance of plant (BOP). After the 
evacuation process is completed, the stack and BOP are isolated from the reactant supply by 
upstream solenoid valves. The total volume evacuated includes the water-management portion 
of the stack assembly and the BOP volume.  

The test data indicate that a sufficient vacuum can be held for several hours. If the system 
downtime is any longer, an inert gas purge should be considered before a system restart. 

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions before and after each test did not show any 
degradation in stack performance.  

I-21 

 
 
 
 
 
EPS Test #5—Frozen Startup  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The intent of this test is to determine what effect sub-freezing temperature 
exposure has on the fuel cell stack ability to start and operate, and to uncover any 
detrimental effects to the fuel cell stack composition.  

•  Shutdown/test criteria—Tests will be run until the baseline temperature of 70°C is 

reached but for no longer than 2 hours. 

2.  Test conditions

•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  2 separate tests based on stack preparation prior to freezing 

•  Prepped with purge—The stack will be dried using a dry, low-pressure N2 purge 
of both the anode and cathode for a minimum of 30 minutes. Following the 
purge, the anode and cathode ports will be isolated, and N2 will remain at 
pressure in the stack during the freezing process. 

•  Prepped with vacuum—The stack will be evacuated by the process of dead-end 
consumption of all remaining reactants. H2 will be added during the process to 
maintain the required stoichiometric mix. The anode and cathode ports will be 
isolated, and the stack will remain in a vacuum state during the freezing process. 
•  Freeze—Prior to each startup test, the stack will be saturated to -20°C by a minimum 

6-hr soak in the LabRepCo freezer set at -20°C. 

•  First Leak Test—Prepped with purge 

•  Following a “prepped with purge” and freeze, perform standard leak check to 

verify membrane integrity. 

•  Startup Test—Prepped with purge. 
•  Following “prepped with purge” and freeze, run startup at 15A (200mA/ cm2) to 70°C 

or 2 hrs. 

•  Second Leak Test—Prepped with vacuum.

Remarks 

The PEM fuel cell operation depends on a well-hydrated membrane. Damage to a hydrated 
membrane as a result of freezing is a concern for the PEM fuel cell when not in operation.  

The testing prepared a 4-cell stack for exposure to freezing conditions using two different 
methods. One method used a nitrogen purge to expel as much liquid water as possible. The 
second method used the evacuation by reactant consumption process, making no attempt to 
remove excess liquid water.  

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions after each test did not show any degradation 
in stack performance.

EPS Test #4—Excess Product Water  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The purpose of this test is to determine the effect of excess product water 
building up within the fuel cell stack. The test will track the decline in performance as 
the water buildup progresses and will check for any permanent effect. 

• 

 Shutdown/test criteria—Tests will be run until a decline in performance becomes 
evident.

Figure I-17—Excess Product Water Test EPS 

Remarks 

Conditions for this test were set up to gradually cause the fuel cell stack to flood while 
monitoring performance. The stack was run at a lower pressure to allow a higher moisture 
content or humidity ratio (mass of water to unit mass of reactant gas). A higher humidification 
temperature also contributed to a higher humidity ratio. The stack was operated at a lower 
temperature to promote condensation of the highly humidified reactants. 

The chart shows the standard performance at the temperature and pressure conditions before 
the onset of flooding. Note the periodic increase in cell voltage is due to an increase in coolant 
temperature as the controller fluctuates the temperature to maintain the thermal load. The lower 
voltage data in the chart show considerable scatter as flooding of the stack progresses. The 
solid line is a linear fit of the scattered data showing a decreasing performance trend due to the 
flooding. 

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions after each test did not show any degradation 
in stack performance.

MPS Test #2—High-Temperature Operation  
EPS Test #3—High-Temperature Operation  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—The purpose of this test is to determine the effect of operating the stack at 
an excessively high temperature. The test will track performance as the stack climbs 
above the nominal alarm-shutdown temperature. A baseline polarization test run will 
determine any cell damage. 

• 

 Shutdown/test criteria—The test will run until the estimated maximum cell 
temperature is considered too extreme or cell failure is evident. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test station—4-cell capable Medusa for 150A, 4 Vdc load. 
•  Temp/pressure—No coolant, no temperature control, 30 psig with H2 and O2.  
•  Reactants—100% H2 and O2, fully humidified to 90°C.  

•  Reactant flows 

•  H2 stoic = 1.5  

•  O2 stoic = 2.5 

•  Load—constant current at 45A (600mA/cm2) 

3.  Baseline test 

•  70°C, 30 psig, H2 stoic = 1.5, and O2 stoic = 2.5 
•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve. 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  Run the stack without coolant and temperature control. Monitor the exterior 

temperature of the graphite bipolar plates using an IR thermometer. Run until 
estimated maximum interior cell temperature exceeds 120°C. 

•  Follow with a baseline test. 

5.  Data requirements 

•  Standard output available from the Medusa test station.  

•  Graphite bipolar, exterior temperature, recorded concurrent with test station data.

Figure I-19—High-Temperature Operation Test 

Remarks 

The coolant was removed for this test. Without a coolant, the internal temperature of the stack 
cannot be measured or controlled. The stack was run at constant current, and the stack 
temperature was allowed to increase. The external temperature of the graphite bipolar plates 
was monitored using an infrared thermometer. At an external temperature of 110ºC, the test 
was terminated. 

The data collected during the test show a decrease in the average cell voltage. This is evidence 
that the stack was drying out at the elevated temperatures. The test-station humidifiers are 
limited to 90ºC. The internal cell temperatures exceeded the humidifier limit enough to begin to 
dry out the cells.  

Polarization data recorded at baseline conditions after the test are shown in figure I-18. After 
operating to a maximum internal temperature estimated to exceed 120 ºC, the polarization data 
does indicate any degradation in stack performance when compared with previous performance 
data.

Rerun EPS Test #7 and MPS Test #6 – Reactant Impurity  

1.  Scope 

•  Purpose—Rerun the reactant impurity test with platinum black catalyst on the 

anodes. The test will look at the decline of individual cell voltages as inert gases 
build up in the reactants and compare with previous tests using a carbon-supported 
catalyst on the anodes.  

•  Shutdown/test criteria—Testing the stack on an open system does not allow the 
inerts to naturally build up. Several reactant mixes with increasing inert gas 
concentrations will be tested to provide data for predicting cell-voltage degradation 
versus inert gas concentration. Reactant stoics will be held constant, and the total 
fuel flow will be increased to compensate for the increase in inert N2. 

2.  Test conditions 

•  Test station—2-cell capable Medusa for 100A, 4 Vdc load 
•  Temp/pressure—70°C, 45 psia 

•  Reactants—fully humidified 

− 100% H2 and O2 for baseline 

− 10%, 30% and 50% N2 in H2 for anode degradation 

•  Reactant flows—up 2.0 SLM H2 & 1.68 O2 for baseline, greater with inert 

contaminated reactants 

•  Load—constant 145W 

3.  Baseline test 

• 

 70°C, 45 psia, 100% H2 and O2 

•  1-hour test followed by polarization curve data 

4.  Testing sequence 

•  9 separate tests with H2—70°C, 45 psia, reactant stoics of 2.5, 2.0 & 1.5 

D. 10% N2 in H2, 100% O2—anode flow (SLM) = 1.9  1.5  1.1 

E. 30% N2 in H2, 100% O2—anode flow (SLM) = 2.2  1.8  1.3 

F. 50% N2 in H2, 100% O2—anode flow (SLM) = 2.5  2.0  1.5

Remarks 

The inert nitrogen content in the reactants was deliberately chosen to be much higher than even 
the worst-case scenarios. The effect on performance from the increased inert concentration and 
reduced stoichiometric content can be seen in figure I-24. Performance degradation is shown as 
maximum average cell voltage drop. The results using a Pt black anode catalyst show a 
tolerance to the reactant with the 50% inert content not seen with the carbon supported Pt 
catalyst.
