16.  Abstract
Current baseline power and energy sources for both fixed wing and Vertical Take-Off 
electric aircraft are batteries.  While batteries meet the need for basic operation their lower 
specific energy translates to limitations on range and performance. Fuel cells, either alone 
or hybridized with batteries project to extend range and improve performance by providing 
higher overall specific energy.  Similarly, manned transport aircraft project to benefit from 
increased specific energy provided by fuel cell systems as well as the ability to distributed 
these power sources within an aircraft.  Unmanned aircraft do not need to meet the 
regulatory requirements of manned transport aircraft however they are exposed to similar 
or even more severe environmental and operational demands.  The approach of the 
current program has been to design, build and test a fuel cell system specifically designed 
to meet the needs of these near term UAS applications, then use this as a baseline to 
compare to meeting the requirements for manned transport.

Executive Summary 

Modern aircraft are becoming increasingly electrified with electrical power loads from 
personal entertainment, controls and propulsion increasing demand, while global 
requirements to decrease carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions are growing.  
Primary fuel cells, that can generate electrical power from various sources, and 
Regenerative Fuel Cells, that can store energy, are receiving increasing attention as 
candidates for next generation aircraft electrical power. Fuel cells have the potential to 
reduce or eliminate pollutants while providing clean, quiet, vibration-free power. 

Early candidates for the application of fuel-cell power include Unmanned Aerial 
Systems, UAS, or drone aircraft, especially in smaller Class I or II sizes. These aircraft, 
whether designed for vertical or horizontal takeoff and landing, project to benefit from 
electrical power and propulsion systems. Fixed-wing drones benefit from electrical 
propulsion by reduced vibration and maintenance. Multi-rotor aircraft benefit from 
increased range, power and energy. For multi-rotor vehicles, electrical propulsion is 
essential since basic operation depends on real-time control and response of multiple 
propulsion motors. Conventional combustion propulsion engines simply cannot perform 
these functions. 

Current baseline power and energy sources for both fixed wing and Vertical TakeOff, 
(VTO) electric aircraft are batteries. While batteries meet the need for basic operation, 
their lower specific energy translates to limitations on range and performance. Fuel 
cells, either alone or hybridized with batteries, project to extend range and improve 
performance by providing higher overall specific energy. Manned transport aircraft 
project to benefit similarly from the increased specific energy provided by fuel cell 
systems as well as from the ability to distributed these power sources within an aircraft.   

Program Approach 

UAS fuel cells as a target system: 

Unmanned aircraft do not need to meet the regulatory requirements of manned 
transport aircraft; however, they are exposed to similar or even more severe 
environmental and operational demands. The approach of the current program has 
been to design, build and test a fuel-cell system specifically designed to meet the needs 
of these near-term UAS applications, then use this as a baseline for comparison in 
meeting the requirements for manned transport. The scope of the current program does 
not require flight test of such systems but does provide a pathway to flight test.   

This project’s approach is to develop a system based upon an open/closed cathode 
Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel-cell concept in which the cathode reactant and 
coolant delivery systems are shared. The simplicity of the air‐cooled stack and its 

1 

 
 
 
 
reduced balance of plant make it attractive for smaller UAS applications in general, 
while the closed cathode (oxygen‐using) component of the design is beneficial for 
dense air and high-altitude applications. 

The new system focuses on reducing volume and weight while still meeting the 
performance and cost targets of a UAS application.

1.0 Program Description and Background 

Fuel cell systems are power‐producing devices with separate energy storage systems 
necessary for proper operation. This effective separation of power and energy is not 
unlike more traditional power and energy systems, e.g., the internal combustion engine 
in a car provides the power to move the vehicle; the energy necessary to fuel the engine 
is stored in the fuel tank. It is exactly this separation of power and energy that makes 
fuel cell systems the “go‐to” power source for many extreme applications. Unlike 
batteries, which provide power and store energy within the same package, a fuel cell 
power and energy system is a combination of mutually exclusive sub systems than can 
be better tailored to provide power at levels independent from the chosen form of 
energy storage. The hydrogen (and possibly oxygen) storage simply drives the 
endurance of the craft being powered by the fuel cell. 

Within the fuel cell each cell converts hydrogen and oxygen to electrical power, water, 
and waste heat, and then passively removes the resulting water. This is achieved by 
introducing oxygen into a chamber on one side of a proton‐conducting polymer 
membrane (the cathode chamber) and hydrogen into the other side (the anode 
chamber). At the anode, the hydrogen is ionized into electrons (providing power) and 
protons in a catalyzed chemical reaction. The protons are conducted through the 
proton‐conducting membrane, drawn by the potential of the oxygen, where they 
combine with the oxygen molecules. 

Infinity Fuel Cell and Hydrogen, Inc. (Infinity) has been developing both air dependent 
and air independent PEM fuel cell systems, as well as high pressure electrolyzers 
producing both hydrogen and oxygen, for the past fourteen years. This work has been 
predominantly funded through NASA and DOD efforts and is presently ongoing. The 
purpose for this work has primarily been the provision of power within spacecraft and 
UUVs, i.e., market segments without the available air usually associated with the use of 
fuel cell‐based power systems.  

1.1 Goal 

The goal of this program is to advance understanding of the development and 
integration issues related to the use of fuels aboard transport aircraft by focusing on 
smaller scale systems in defined applications such as UAVs. Designing and testing of a 
fuel cell stack and balance of system that demonstrates the ability of a fuel cell power 
plant to power an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) with little vibration impacting 
payloads, little to no noise imparted to the local environment, and increased endurance 
over traditional technologies. These are all issues pertinent to adoption of UAS in many 
commercial markets.  

Fuel cell integration onboard transport aircraft may begin to fit a variety of needs as the 
aircraft community, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance, begins to 

3 

 
 
 
understand and implement the technology. Among the many uses of this type of power 
system is its possible incorporation in the passenger area in the form of additional galley 
power, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) for electronics, emergency power, etc. When 
operating in the passenger area the use of air versus stored oxygen is of critical 
importance, as the consumption of air necessary for passenger breathing cannot be 
impacted due to the operation of a fuel cell. In this scenario the ability of a fuel cell-
based power system to consume stored oxygen during all or part of a flight may 
become a necessity. The adaptation of the fuel cell system developed as part of this 
program is being assessed in the future for potential application to transport aircraft and 
other oxygen-breathing fuel cell environments. 

In the UAS market there is presently a need for the type of fuel cell system such as 
Infinity is developing that is the subject of this report. The use of a fuel cell system 
inherently brings benefits that Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and battery-based 
power systems cannot. Many applications in this market require longer endurance than 
battery systems alone can provide, e.g., Facebook’s Aquila1 drone that was being 
developed to provide Internet access in remote locations underserved or not served at 
all. At these high altitudes the need for oxygen breathing fuel cell power systems is 
clear: low partial pressure of oxygen at 50,000 feet and above, the typical altitude for 
High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft, precludes the use of air breathing fuel 
cell systems without the addition of compressors designed to increase oxygen 
concentration, but which also decrease system reliability and increase Mean Time 
Between Overhaul (MTBO).  

At lower altitudes the issue of flight endurance is more critical. Present battery 
technology typically provides a 20-minute flight time for lower Maximum Take Off 
Weight (MTOW) vehicles, e.g., quad copters carrying cameras for still and video 
imagery, to approximately 90-minute flight times for military fixed wing aircraft 
performing overwatch and surveillance functions. These latter functions, performed by 
Group 1 (20 lb. MTOW) and Group 2 (21-55 lb. MTOW) UAS, are typically powered by 
either 2- or 4-stroke ICEs. These ICE powered aircraft have the ability to fly much 
longer than battery powered platforms, having achieved, in some cases, over 2 days 
flight time2. 

There is enormous interest in both military and commercial markets for noiseless and 
vibrationless flight. Vibration from ICE power plants impact the cameras mounted in the

2 UAV Factory Penguin B (Infinity owns an electric version of this aircraft for future testing of fuel cell 
power systems). https://www.suasnews.com/2012/07/fifty-four-hour-flight-for-uav-factory-penguin-b/

payload bays3. This issue impacts both military and commercial customers. Likewise, 
noise level in airborne platforms for both military and commercial markets is a concern. 
In the military the acoustic signature affects the stealth of a mission. For most airframes 
of the Group 1 and 2 varieties the largest contributor to noise level is the propeller and 
not the ICE powering it4, however, a fuel cell power plant driving a low-noise propeller5 
provides a complete solution to the problem. For commercial markets of the future a 
noise-free environment below the flight paths of airborne delivery platforms may be a 
requirement. A fuel cell system can satisfy both vibration and noise issues. As a solid-
state device, the technology is inherently quiet in operation, with only balance of system 
components adding to noise levels. Infinity’s traditional oxygen-breathing fuel cell 
design, with a reduced balance of system, provides a reduced noise level over 
competing fuel cell technologies. Incorporating the fundamental elements of this design 
to an air-breathing fuel cell platform, while not the subject of this activity, is certainly the 
direction Infinity would like to move in the future. The objective for this activity is the 
development of a lightweight fuel cell stack and minimized balance of system. 

For several other government and commercial activities, the ability to fly in 
environments devoid of air or in debris-strewn air is critical. Several federal agencies 
find a use for the operation of UAS in these environments: National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) Earth Sciences Directorate studying volcanic plumes; 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gathering data inside 
hurricane systems; Department of Defense (DOD) battlefield environments with Small 
Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) operating in low altitude overwatch capacity. 
Oxygen acting as the oxidant for a fuel cell power system provides a closed cathode 
solution versus the open cathode design of most air-breathing fuel cells, or the air intake 
of an ICE system. Additionally, many of these markets would benefit from the ability to 
be able to fly into a compromised environment using ambient air, switchover to oxygen 
within the compromised environment, and then back to air to get home. This air-oxygen-
air switchover capability would enable the UAS to operate at a much lower MTOW, 
since the oxygen storage requirement is minimized. A dual oxidant fuel cell architecture 
is a focus of this effort, but initial implementation of this architecture has bene focused 
on the H2/Air operation.

2.0 Description of Target Aircraft and Subsystems 

The aircraft targeted by Infinity for initial testing of a fuel cell system is a UAV Factory 
Penguin BE. This is an electric version of UAV Factory’s popular 50 lb. MTOW airframe 
sold around the globe. Infinity acquired a stripped-down version of the Penguin BE in 
2016 for the purposes of integrating and testing fuel cell systems for long endurance 
flight. 

2.1 State of The Art Airframes and Engines 

The power and energy system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of 
satisfying the requirements for fixed wing airframes requires a reassessment of the 
manner in which power is provided to the standard UAV today. A traditional UAV 
platform in the 50 lb. MTOW class utilizes a gasoline-fueled ICE and a generator driven 
by the ICE for power supply to onboard equipment and payloads. Figure 2 illustrates a 
typical UAV platform in the 50 lb. MTOW class utilizing a pusher type propeller. A 
version of this particular airframe, the Penguin B, set an endurance record of 54.4 hours 
of non-stop flight in 20126, powered by a fuel injected ICE. This flight time is most likely 
achieved in the particular airframe under controlled conditions without a payload

2.2 Traditional UAV Propulsion 

The ICE-based energy system (engine and fuel storage), seen in Figure 3, is the UAV 
Factory’s fuel injected ICE deployed in their Penguin product line7. This fully integrated 
energy system contains the prime mover, fuel storage, controls, and generator required 
for powering avionics and onboard customer payloads. The prime mover in this case is 
a single cylinder, two-stroke, air cooled 28 cc engine. This 2.1 kW engine turns the belt-
driven generator that provides either 80 or 100 W, depending on the instrumentation 
located in the payload bay. This example is illustrated for two reasons: 1) it is the most 
detailed presentation found on state-of-the-art UAV power systems; 2) it shows some of 
the components contained in these state-of-the-art systems that may be duplicative, or 
not needed, with the implementation of a fuel cell power and energy system. 

Figure 3 UAV Factory Fuel Injected ICE Energy System (Approx. Dims) 

The 28-cc engine used in UAV Factory’s airframes consumes approximately 400 g/kWh 
in cruise mode8 and uses automotive grade gasoline at 98 octane. For the listed 20-
hour flight time at an estimated cruise power of 1.5 kW (71% of peak power output), the 
total fuel storage requirement would be 12 kg. Adding this value to the rest of the 
energy system yields the total mass listed in Table 1, or 30.29 lb. The engine mass 
includes an 80-100 W generator, cooling, servo, and air filter. The engine control unit 
requires 10-24 VDC at less than 15 kW (max RPM). The fuel consumption noted 

7 UAV28-EFI Turnkey Fuel Injected Engine, http://www.uavfactory.com/product/77. 
8 Ibid. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
accounts for an approximate fuel use of 400 g/kWh (max power output)9. The typical 
rule of thumb for estimating the mass of a complete energy system for a 50 lb. MTOW 
class UAV is approximately 40-50% of total mass, or between 20-25 lb. (max).10 These 
data provide a reasonable starting point for the development of a UAV fuel cell power 
and energy system. 

Table 1 UAV Factory ICE System Main Component Mass & Life Characteristics 

UAV Factory’s ICE energy system is a well-integrated power plant utilizing advanced 
manufacturing techniques and leveraging present control technologies to provide longer 
endurance than many other airframe manufacturers in the same class. Several other 
airframe makers, ICE manufacturers, and fuel cell providers have been working to 
improve endurance in this class of UAV as well. 

2.3 Electric UAV Propulsion 

Northwest UAV (NWUAV) is a well-known manufacturer and supplier of ICE-based 
power systems for UAVs, most notably supplying the engines for Insitu’s ScanEagle 
and Integrator platforms. Along with superior design and development of small ICEs, 
NWUAV has also worked toward the development of electric propulsion systems for 
UAVs under Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) funding, see Figure 4. This propulsion 
development work may dovetail nicely with Infinity’s lightweight fuel cell research and 
development. Infinity has a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in place with NWUAV to 
discuss integration opportunities for a fuel cell energy system to power fixed wing craft.

of fuel. Based on conversations with Unmanned Aerial Surveillance, a Temecula, California based end

Boeing also produces a drone through its subsidiary, Insitu, primarily for military use

motor of this approximately 50 lb. MTOW airframe is in the range of 1 kW12. 

2.4 Targeted Airframe 

The UAV Factory’s Penguin BE, referenced earlier, is the targeted airframe for this 
program. Part of the front payload bay is consumed by a battery, as seen in Figure 5. 
This version of the airframe is based on the traditionally-powered craft but uses a 
Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery instead. This electric propulsion arrangement still 
provides a large payload bay and also opens up free space toward the aft of the

versus the ICE powered version of the aircraft. The product and performance

approximately 110 minutes. 

Figure 6 Penguin B Electric Propulsion System 

Infinity has acquired a Penguin BE from UAV Factory using Internal Research and 
Development (IRAD) funding. After a thorough evaluation of several airframes available 
in the 50 lb. class, it was determined that UAV Factory has the most viable aircraft for 
fuel cell integration for this and other projects. Also, as a Group 2 aircraft, this platform 
with a fuel cell would ease early product introduction into both military and commercial 
surveillance markets. 

2.5 Targeted Aircraft Subsystems 

The subsystems in Infinity’s Penguin BE include the motor and motor controller, servos 
for all control surfaces, landing gear, and overall airframe. Additional subsystems 
required to fly the aircraft include, but are not limited to, the major components as listed 
in this section.  

2.5.1 Autopilot 

The autopilot system recommended for the UAV Factory Penguin B platform is either a 
Piccolo, made by Cloud Cap Technology14, or a Kestrel, made by Procerus 
Technologies15. One of these autopilot systems would be integrated into the platform in 
the future should flight testing be performed. This integration would be done through a 
third-party team responsible for avionics integration, ground controls, and flight. 

The fuel cell system onboard the platform will accommodate a range of potential 
autopilot solutions, as illustrated in Table 4; most importantly the voltage and power

Systems (UTAS) in 2012.

requirements. These systems will also require antenna, GPS, radio, and other 
components as necessary for full implementation and flight.

Controlling the Penguin BE airframe in flight requires a radio system to communicate 
with the onboard radio. The UAV Factory provides a ground control station as an 
optional package. Unmanned Aerial 
Surveillance in Temecula, California, or a 
similar company, would be engaged to 
provide the ground control station and 
flight expertise for any in-flight 
demonstrations in the future. This 
precludes the need for Infinity to acquire 
its own ground control station and 
leverages those already in the UAV 
surveillance market to perform specific 
testing to be defined by the Infinity team.

3.0 Design Study  

3.1 Concept of Operations 

A full Concept of Operations (ConOps) has not been developed as a stand-alone 
document for this program; rather it is presented in this section in summarized form, 
drawing from other information in this report. It is not the intention of the Infinity team to 
fly the fuel cell system developed under this contract. It is helpful, however, to realize a 
potential ConOps strategy as an informative tool in the engineering process.  

3.1.1 Introduction 

The UAS community desires a noiseless and vibrationless power system with a long 
endurance energy system. Present state of the art for UAS is either a battery system or 
an ICE; the former proving power output and energy storage from the same module, the 
latter providing separated power and energy storage sub systems for longer flight times. 
The ICE systems tend to impart vibrations on sensitive payloads while batteries do not. 
Batteries simply cannot provide the flight endurance of ICE systems. No power and 
energy system for UAS can presently provide noiseless, vibrationless, long endurance 
flight. 

In addition to the above-referenced issues is the ability of UAS to fly in and out of 
hazardous environments. A hazardous environment can be defined as hot air, dense 
air, debris-strewn air, high altitude low partial pressure oxygen, etc. These environments 
preclude the use of ICE systems, since the intake air required to operate the ICE can be 
compromised. Battery systems can operate in these environments, but at reduced flight 
times versus ICE systems.  

Infinity has started the development of a unique air/oxygen fuel cell system that will 
allow not only for flight into and out of hazardous environments, but also provide 
extended flight time due to use of oxygen within the compromised flight environment 
while consuming air when outside of it. This latter point minimizes the quantity of 
oxygen to carry onboard, thereby minimizing overall UAS weight and contributing to 
extended flight time. Development of the lightweight, air-breathing fuel cell stack and 
system during this program is the first step toward realizing this dual oxidant approach 
to fuel cell systems. 

3.1.2 Problem Statement 

The initial problem statement requirement was to “Develop a lightweight Infinity fuel cell 
and hydrogen storage system for the purposes of integrating into a UAS airframe for 
benchtop testing. This preliminary testing will eventually lead to integration of oxygen-
breathing capability (dual oxidant) and ultimately possible flight testing.”  

14 

 
 
 
3.1.3 System History 

The air/oxygen fuel cell power system for UAS proposed by Infinity for this effort is not a 
system currently in use in the unmanned market. There is concern in the UAS 
community regarding flight time, power delivery to more payloads, and flying into and 
out of compromised airspace. A “compromised airspace” is defined by Infinity for the 
UAS market as one which lacks the quantity or quality of necessary air to feed an ICE 
powered craft. Battery powered craft can certainly provide UAV propulsion through 
these environments, but for a limited timeframe and sometimes resulting in loss of the 
UAS platform. 

The loss of vehicle issue is best illustrated by 
NOAA’s present use of Raytheon’s Coyote UAV, 
seen in Figure 9. This system is tube launched 
from a manned aircraft flying above a hurricane. 
As the this particular UAS is released from the 
tube its wings unfold and it is remotely piloted 
down into the eye of the hurricane. After 
descending into the storm and gathering data for 
just over an hour the UAS battery is depleted and 
the vehicle is carried away by the storm. Each 
Coyote costs NOAA approximately $22,000. 

Figure 9 NOAA scientist Paul Reasor 
holding a Raytheon Coyote UAV 

As to limited time for data gathering, an example of a 
former NASA program run out of Ames Research 
Center utilized several AeroVironment Dragon Eye 
UAV platforms to study volcanic plumes16. Described 
as a “dense air” environment, a volcanic plume 
presents many challenges for a traditional ICE 
powered platform, whereas a fuel cell powered system, 
operating on oxygen inside the dense air environment, 
would allow for extended duration of data gathering 
versus current battery solutions providing one-hour 
flight endurance. 

Figure 10 NASA 2013 Volcanic Plume 
Measurement Program 

3.1.4 System Use 

A flexible air/oxygen fuel cell system for UAS would be used in extreme environments 
where a compromised atmosphere precludes the use of ICE based power systems and 

16 https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/earthmonth/volcanic-plume-uavs.html  

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when flight times within these compromised environments necessitates longer duration 
flight. 

Environments benefitting from the use of this system would include: 

a)  Hurricane and storm data gathering 
b)  Volcanic plume measurements 
c)  Forest fire overwatch and spotting 
d)  Military battlefield overwatch and surveillance 
e)  Oil and gas market offshore rig inspections 

For these and other potential applications, the UAS incorporating an air/oxygen fuel cell 
power and energy system would fly into and out of the compromised airspace 
consuming ambient air to sustain fuel cell power generation. When entering the 
compromised airspace, the energy system switches from air to oxygen. While in the 
compromised environment the fuel cell will consume only the oxygen carried onboard 
the airframe. Upon exiting the compromised environment, the system will switch from 
oxygen to air to complete the mission. Hydrogen will be consumed by the fuel cell 
throughout the flight. 

Hydrogen storage, therefore, is driven by the total length of the flight. Oxygen storage, 
on the other hand, is determined only by estimated flight duration within the 
compromised environment. This is advantageous from a Size, Weight, and Power 
(SWaP) perspective, since the physical mass of the oxygen per unit stored by volume is 
eight times that of the mass of the hydrogen per unit stored by volume. 

3.1.5 Preliminary Flight Plan 

This is a long-term objective of Infinity’s broader development program regarding 
lightweight fuel cells for UAS applications.  

Referencing Lockheed Martin’s FlightService17 for filing UAS operating in uncontrolled 
airspace, as well as the testing objectives of this program, the following is a very brief 
description of a preliminary flight plan. 

Maximum Altitude: 

2,000 ft 

Operating Area: 

Circular, 2 nm radius, center point TBD 

Operating Time: 

2-hour total with several intermittent switchovers between air 
and oxygen subsystems (total oxygen operation time not to 
exceed 30 minutes) 

17 https://www.1800wxbrief.com/Website/#!/ 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
The operation of the aircraft would be performed by a partner of Infinity, since no Infinity 
employees are skilled in flying, or licensed to fly, the target aircraft. 

3.2 System Requirements  

3.2.1 System Boundaries 

The interface control volume of the air/oxygen fuel cell energy system is defined as a 
combination of modules. The system is comprised of a power module and an energy 
module. Each of these modules for this particular program is planned to be capable of 
being installed into the airframe as separate components. The power module is 
comprised of the fuel cell stack, DC-DC converter, battery, instrumentation and controls. 
The energy module is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen storage tanks with controls 
for each. Communication, both fluid and electric, between the two modules is planned to 
be accomplished via quick connections where possible when fully implemented. 

The system is designed to be a self-starting system requiring no external equipment to 
power up the UAS platform. A battery provides power to the control system when the 
start command is sent. This operation will also open the reactant valves to begin fuel 
cell power generation. Once reactant is flowing to the fuel cell the system will load 
follow, i.e., provide power on demand to airframe control system, motor, and payloads.  

3.2.2 System Environment 

A fuel cell power and energy system for use in a Class 2 aircraft should be able to 
withstand the demands of startup at sea level to 10,000 ft ASL, with the ability to reach 
maximum altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 ft ASL. These requirements drive ambient 
operating conditions for temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and partial pressure of 
oxygen in the air. 

The operator of the UAS will be stationed on the ground and flying the vehicle through a 
Ground Control Station (GCS); a typical system for the target airframe is illustrated in 
Figure 8. 

Maintenance of the fuel cell power module shall be performed on the ground and will 
ideally consume no more than part of one day for overhaul. It is estimated that the fuel 
cell power system will last, under nominal operating conditions, between 2,000 and 
5,000 operating hours. The energy storage module, consisting of lightweight Type III or 
IV hydrogen and oxygen tanks, filling mechanisms, and associated controls, shall be 
accessible at the time of power module removal. Ideally, the power module and energy 
module will reach End of Life (EOL) at approximately the same time, but this is not a 
hard requirement. 

3.2.3 Requirements 

The fuel cell power and energy system design requirements are based on meeting the 
market objectives of both military and commercial UAS applications. A description of 

17 

 
 
 
each major requirement is listed below with a summary at the end of this section in 
Table 6. 

3.2.3.1 Cost 
A major driver for a fuel cell system is cost. Battery pricing for conventional LiPo and Li-
ion packs typically used to power smaller UAS platforms have dropped significantly over 
the past several years and are projected to decrease further in the future. Much of the 
progress in battery chemistries has been an outgrowth of the electric vehicle market, 
see Figure 11, with gravimetric and volumetric energy densities projected to increase in 
the out years while costs continue to drop18. 

The cost targets for a fuel cell based UAS power system can be correlated to this 
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) development as well as to present ICE costs in the UAS 
market. Furthermore, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when fuel cells are compared 
to ICE power solutions should be favorable since the MTBO for the fuel cell-based

TCO, accounting for acquisition costs, operating expenses, overhaul expenses, cost of 
overhaul downtime, rates of return, etc. will need to be examined more closely in the 
future for development of a complete business case. 

For the purposes of this exercise, the cost of a fully commercialized fuel cell power and 
energy system should fall within the bounds of a battery system for short and medium 
endurance flights into and out of compromised airspace. See Table 5 for a comparison 
of projected battery costs for the year 2020.

3.2.3.2 Weight 
As noted, the overall ICE mass for the targeted aircraft is 13.74 kg (reference Table 1). 
This figure is inclusive of the fuel required to fly approximately 20 hours. A fuel cell 
system capable of replacing the ICE system will need to be similar to this total mass or 
lighter than it to meet the 10 kg payload objectives of the aircraft. 

3.2.3.3 Performance 
With an output of approximately 2.1 kW peak, the ICE for the targeted airframe is a very 
capable small engine with a small footprint. The electric version of the same aircraft is 
provided with a 3-kW motor and a LiPo battery to drive it. Based on prior discussions 
and research, this motor may be a bit large for the airframe; other companies leverage 
smaller electric drives for similar applications. Therefore, the output power from the fuel 
cell system under development is in the 1 kW to 3 kW range; most likely at the lower 
end of this range. 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.3.4 Life Expectancy 
The fuel cell systems designed and built by Infinity for NASA and DOD missions are 
capable of providing reliable power output for 20,000 hours or more. In UAS 
applications the service life requirement is far less. To meet the needs of this market, 
while providing better service life than traditional power technologies, the desire is to 
build a fuel cell system capable of at least 2,000 hours and perhaps up to 5,000 hours. 
Life of the product beyond the 5,000-hour mark may drive additional costs in the 
product’s design, yielding less benefit to the UAS consumer.

assessment and technical airframe needs. This table represents an overall design

3.3 Design Analysis 

A goal of this program is the development of a design architecture of a fuel cell-based 
power and energy system capable of powering a UAS platform. In the course of doing 
so, the fuel cell system should be able to effectively switch between oxidants feeding 
the fuel cell, i.e., air and oxygen. The ability to effectively demonstrate this technique 
may open further market potential in the UAS community. More importantly, however, it 
may further demonstrate the capability of a fuel cell system to provide dual oxidant 
operation that may one day lead to the technology’s acceptance onboard passenger 
aircraft. 

While the dual oxidant design remains a goal, catalyst differences between air- and 
oxygen-breathing fuel cells is a cost and development issue. Therefore, a standard air-
breathing platform was chosen as the initial implementation of the system architecture 
with provision in the design to accommodate the active switchover capability as 
resources permit. 

The following design analysis details our approach to achieving this goal and describes 
design-tradeoffs. 

3.3.1 System Analysis 

The fuel cell itself will provide power to the aircraft and is decoupled from the energy 
storage system, i.e., hydrogen. Power generation, therefore, can be scaled 
appropriately to meet aircraft power needs; the volume of energy storage is driven only 
by flight time requirements.   This section reviews the power, energy and environmental 
demands. 

3.3.1.1 Power Demands 
The peak power requirement for the Infinity owned Penguin BE aircraft, as received 
from the vendor is approximately 3 kW, primarily due to the due to the A60-5SV2  
Hacker electric motor in the aircraft with a peak power rating of 2,600 watts. The Infinity 
team believes, after conversations with users of the same aircraft, that this motor may 
be oversized for the application. Other electric motors are available for Class 2 UAS that 
may have a much lower input power requirement on the order of approximately 1 kW. 
Therefore, the nominal power for fuel cell stack, in a fuel cell only configuration, was set 
as a 1 kW output with potential for a peak output power at 1.5 kW. As referenced 
earlier, other Class 2 aircraft operate with similarly sized motors.  Also, in a hybrid 
battery-fuel cell configuration the existing motor may be suitable with the battery able to 
provide the peak power and the fuel cell provide the majority of cruise power.

3.3.1.2 Energy Storage 
Infinity has explored several options for the storage of hydrogen, comparing market 
introduction, economics, availability, etc. The Department of Energy (DOE) has done an 
enormous amount of analysis and provided funding for research of storage technologies 
and this report leverages that work. 

Infinity continues to be in discussions with several manufacturers of hydrogen storage 
technologies and has an NDA in place with Ardica Technologies to discuss forward 
options for the materials-based storage of hydrogen beyond the near-term. 

3.3.1.2.1 Hydrogen Storage Technologies 
The storage of hydrogen onboard the UAS platform can make or break the overall 
efficiency and cost of the fuel cell system. There are several storage methodologies 
being employed across multiple market segments today and each can be effective. The 
significant challenges in storing hydrogen onboard UAS are mass and volume. There is 
a broad range of technologies available for the storage of hydrogen, however, the focus 
of this effort was two-fold: near-term applicability and long-term effectiveness. 

The hydrogen storage technologies landscape can be seen in Figure 12 on a volumetric 
versus gravimetric capacity basis19. Current hydrogen storage technologies are focused

on maximizing storage potential while minimizing product cost long-term. The base 
chart is a current snapshot of storage technologies maintained by the DOE primarily for 
the automotive markets and includes gaseous, chemical, cryocompressed, and liquid 
hydrogen storage comparisons. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) analysis indicates 
the present range of alane performance to be between 3 to 4.5 wt% hydrogen storage20 
on the chart, and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) analysis indicates the 
maximum expected performance of alane-based storage systems at 10 wt% or 
greater21. 

The upper section of Figure 13 illustrates technology comparisons for the DOE 
automotive hydrogen storage effort, focusing on a longer-term production view of 
500,000 units per year22. The lower portion of Figure 13 represents a technology, α-
alane, developed by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and manufactured 
under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) by Ardica 
Technologies. This latter material may provide a sea change in hydrogen storage

capability if the costs of manufacturing and recharging the aluminum-based material can 
be brought down to commercial levels. BNL indicates a near-term storage potential of 
5.5 wt% and a long-term potential of ~10 wt%. Current compressed gas storage can 
provide approximately 4.5 wt%. Table 7 illustrates a recent survey of available 
composite storage tanks across a variety of fluids and certifications. These types of 
tanks can be made or acquired near-term.

The near-term approach for Infinity’s UAS fuel cell system employs compressed gas in 
a Type III tank while exploring longer-term and cost-effective solutions that can 
minimize mass and volume of a complete system. To this end, Infinity is actively 
working with HyperComp Engineering as a source for a type IV tank similar to the ones 
employed in the Toyota Mirai. This solution could supply ample hydrogen for long 
duration flights while leveraging very mature refueling technologies that, while not 
ubiquitous presently, could be implemented quite easily in the near term. 

Table 7  Survey of Available Composite Tanks by Application and Certification 

Alternative storage technologies outside of those listed in this report are also being 
explored by Infinity as part of an ongoing effort to maximize both gravimetric and 
volumetric densities for UAS power and energy systems. 

3.3.1.2.2 Oxidant Storage Technologies 
The storage and refilling of oxygen require special care. There are two ways to store 
oxygen: gaseous oxygen (GOX) and liquid oxygen (LOX). Each can be delivered 
through typical commercial channels; however, safety requirements must be adhered to 
during transport, filling, and storage. Furthermore, the material selection of the storage 
tanks is of critical importance, with several materials, e.g., titanium, being ill-advised for 
use23. 

The storage of oxygen as LOX yields the greatest volumetric efficiency, but introduces a 
heavier storage device. For the UAV market it becomes challenging to accommodate 
the complexities of commercial refilling in the field. GOX storage is much more 
amenable to smaller UAVs but comes with the penalty of reduced energy density, 
therefore requiring greater volume within the airframe. GOX for the respiratory care 
market is ubiquitous and well-established. Standard storage cylinders have moved from

2,000 psi24.  

A third option is the use of stored air. While compatible with air-breathing fuel cell 
catalyst, stored air requires far more volume than oxygen. This can be a limiting factor 
in its implementation on smaller UAVs.  

3.3.2 Dual Oxidant Switchover 

The prime goal of this effort is the development of a fuel cell system to be tested within 
a UAV platform and use this design as a basis for reviewing and evaluating 
upgrades/changes required to meet FAA operational and safety standards, e.g. 14 CFR 
Part 25 (transport aircraft), Part 107 (SUAS). 

Introducing oxygen onto the cathode side of a Membrane and Electrode Assembly 
(MEA), which has been cost-reduced and optimized for air rather than oxygen, will 
serve to increase the degradation of the cathode catalyst unless the catalysis support 
structure is designed for O2 operation. Typical commercial H2/air MEAs utilize a carbon 
supported design which provides excellent performance with air as the oxidant.   

In pure oxygen and/or at higher (electrolysis) voltages, these carbon supports can be 
attacked and degrade. For example, during fuel starvation and start-stop events high 
potentials can occur leading to rapid carbon support oxidation and loss as CO2.This can 
be mitigated by adding a cell reversal tolerant catalyst able to catalyze oxygen evolution 
from water to provide an alternate oxidation reaction to CO2 formation.25   

Infinity utilizes H2/O2 designed MEAs in air independent fuel cell designs however 
these are typically considerably more costly than H2/Air MEAs.  For the purposes of this 
initial design and fabrication cycle we decided to use lower cost conventional catalyst 
structures that can be readily upgraded in the future for dual oxidant use.   

The ultimate system for the UAS market will be a dual oxidant platform utilizing 
compressed air storage. Although much less energy dense, this method would require 
the least modification to the catalyst layers within the fuel cell and therefore represents 
the least resource intensive approach to a minimum viable product. For this program, 
the development of the fuel cell stack hardware consumed most of the available 
resources and the dual oxidant approach as part of the current package was 
abandoned. This allowed the development team to focus on the lightweight, cost-
effective fuel cell stack design.

3.4 Power System Design and Modeling  

Infinity’s present fuel cell architecture is well-suited for air independent operation, i.e., 
utilizing pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants. The introduction of air into the present 
platform requires design changes to several internal components, including bi polar 
plates (BPPs), advanced water removal, MEA, etc. Furthermore, the reduction of BPP 
and MEA costs is critical to the development of a low-cost fuel cell platform capable of 
serving the UAS and transport aircraft markets. Given these required changes, the 
Infinity team began a fuel cell stack design effort to meet the demands of an air-
breathing architecture as a primary goal, while possibly maintaining the potential for 
inclusion of oxygen or stored air to provide dense air environment operation in the 
future. 

Any fuel cell system utilized for UAS propulsion, as well as FAA testing as part of this 
effort, should at the very least address market requirements for the UAS community. 
The driving elements of a successful fuel cell power and energy system that can 
compete with ICE and battery-based systems will include the following: high gravimetric 
and volumetric efficiencies; lower TCO than ICE and battery systems. Embedded in the 
TCO calculation are first and operating costs. 

3.4.1 Preliminary Stack Performance Design  

The final prototype product is an air-breathing proton exchange membrane fuel cell 
(PEMFC) to be bench tested with appropriate hydrogen storage and ambient air feed. A 
baseline objective was established to address the need for, and the design potential of, 
a dual oxidant system. This type of fuel cell would consume ambient air drawn from a 
fan or compressor, but also be able to utilize stored air or oxygen from an onboard tank. 
Infinity’s background in building hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell systems provided a natural 
starting point for oxygen storage over air.  

26 

 
 
 
Each fuel cell stack is comprised of individual repeat elements and capped at both ends 
with non-repeating end hardware. Much like a battery, these individual cells, when 
connected in series, produce a voltage equal to the individual cell voltage multiplied by 
the number of cells in series. This stack of cells, and therefore the power system itself, 
must be able to feed a standard electrical bus in a UAS with maximum efficiency. If a 
DC-DC converter is to be used as part of a power management and distribution (PMAD) 
device, then a fairly tight input voltage to the converter should be provided from the fuel 
cell stack. Figure 14 illustrates the price/efficiency of DC-DC converters versus input 
voltage for another Infinity application. The electrical bus voltage chosen for the drone 
system is a consistent 24 VDC or greater. 

Figure 14  DC-DC Converter Example 

To maintain a consistent voltage output level, the fuel cell stack must be designed with 
both beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL) estimations to properly predict 
performance over a specified lifetime. Implicit to this design consideration are 
appropriate estimates of voltage degradation rates per hour, as well as degradation due 
to start/stop cycling of the fuel cell system. Leveraging Infinity’s proprietary modeling 
tools, and assuming reasonable mission profiles over a period of time, appropriate 
product predications can be made. Figure 15 represents the estimated BOL 
performance of a complete fuel cell stack operating on air and hydrogen at reasonable 
stoichiometric rates of consumption. All the analyses presented assume hydrogen 
supplied at 99.99% purity. Hydrogen quality below this value, most notably at 99.95% 
may be evaluated and tested at a later date. This “4 nines” versus “3 nines” assessment 
of fuel quality delivered to the fuel cell stack can become critical during operation in the 
field and may limit lifetime of the stack as well as flight time.

3.4.2 System Packaging and Modeling 

Early modeling of a proposed fuel cell system contained within the targeted airframe 
focused on a 12-hour flight time. The system would be comprised of a power module 

Figure 16  Fuel Cell Energy System in Acquired Airframe 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
and energy module, as seen in Figure 16, and would utilize available volume. This 
analysis yielded a 3-kW power module (to power the existing motor in the airframe) and 
a Type IV tank containing compressed hydrogen at 700 bar, providing 8 hours of flight 
time. Given that the electric motor supplied by the Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM) is oversized for the application (and the goals of this project), a smaller electric 
motor may be acquired. This smaller motor will require less energy storage and will free 
some volume for a small oxygen tank. This power and energy system consume the 
entirety of the payload bay and is not intended to demonstrate payload-carrying 
capability. Rather, this program is intended to demonstrate the ability of a UAS to fly on 
a dual oxidant fuel cell power system, and not necessarily for the 8-hour flight time 
originally modeled by the Infinity team. The combination of reduced flight time and 
power requirements may ultimately yield a system with smaller tanks, lower pressure 
storage, and smaller fuel cell power module.

3.4.3 Fuel Cell Repeat Element Bi Polar Plate Design 

The hydrogen and oxygen fuel cells developed by Infinity to date rely on a much 
different operating paradigm than that required for the drone market. Very robust and 
capable of removing product water in each individual cell, Infinity’s present fuel cell 
hardware is simply too expensive for the more cost-competitive drone markets. The 
drone fuel cell must be easily manufactured and lightweight enough to satisfy the 
MTOW of targeted aircraft. The active area of the fuel cell – that area covered by the 
catalyzed membrane through which the electrochemical reaction producing power, heat, 
and water takes place – must be critically sized to maintain projected power levels. 

A BPP serves two functions in a fuel cell: 1) the BPP directs reactants into each cell of 
the fuel cell stack; 2) the BPP provides a serialized electrical connection between cells 
in a fuel cell stack. For decades the material of choice for BPPs was graphite. It is easily 

29 

 
 
 
 
machinable and provides good electrical conductivity through the fuel cell stack. 
Graphite, however, can be brittle and easily damaged in operation. Furthermore, it is 
generally a thicker material when employed as a BPP, with a higher mass than other 
materials. For these and other reasons many fuel cell manufacturers (Infinity included) 
have chosen to employ metallic BPPs. Metal plates can be significantly lighter than 
graphite while providing excellent electrical conductivity. The down sides of employing 
metal as a BPP lie in its corrosiveness in a fuel cell environment, necessity for bonding 
of several layers, and choosing a cost-effective method of forming thin sheets. 

Many methods have been employed to form sheet metal. For the types of metal foil of 
interest in aerospace and fuel cell markets, three processes dominate: 1) Stamping; 2) 
Hydroforming; 3) Rubber Pad Forming, see Table 8. Each method has advantages and 
disadvantages.  

Table 8 Metal Forming Processes 

The stamping process requires both positive and negative tooling dies and fairly high 
pressures. The tooling is typically placed in a hydraulic press with the sheet metal to be 
formed in between the tooling. Alignment of the die set is critical. Since the tooling die 
set imparts significant impact forces to the sheet metal – a key parameter to proper 
stamping – the dies must be manufactured from hardened steel, which drives up the 
first cost, however the part cost is rather low.  

The hydroforming process is an alternative to conventional matched die forming, e.g. 
metal stamping. Developed over the course of the 20th century, the process leverages 
water or oil as a working fluid while eliminating the impact forces associated with 
stamping. As a result, the process provides a lower first cost and reasonable part costs. 

30 

 
 
 
 
There are limitations associated with feature designs but the process is amenable to the 
fabrication of fuel cell BPPs.  

The rubber pad process, also known as the Guerin process, generally utilizes a single 
tool and a rubber pad. The die is placed in a low-pressure press with the material to be 
formed located between the die and the rubber pad. The rubber pad – generally a 
urethane – is used as the pressing “fluid”, forcing the sheet metal into the features 
located on the tool die. This process is well established in the aerospace market where 
lower volumes of precise parts are typically required. The one die approach translates 
to lower first costs, while the greater time per press lends itself to lower volume 
production, i.e., higher part costs than conventional forming methods.  

For the development of an air-breathing fuel cell for the UAS community, Infinity 
selected a hybrid rubber pad forming process. With low first costs this method fits 
budgetary and scheduling constraints. Furthermore, the potential for pulling the process 
in-house would provide part cost reductions through the beta phase of product 
development and into early commercial release. Figure 17 illustrates the concept for 
both male and female molding tools, along with a BPP between the two. 

The stacking arrangement of repeat hardware in the fuel cell stack follows a non-

Figure 17 BiPolar Plate and Forming Tools 

traditional A-B-C-A approach; A=anode flow field, B=MEA, C=cathode flow field, Figure 
18. A traditional graphite BPP is relatively thick and allows for the pressing or machining 
of anode and cathode flow fields on either side of the plate. When using thin metal foils 
to form flow fields the BPP is actually two flow fields placed back-to-back in the stacking 
profile such that the back side of both the anode and the cathode plates are in contact 
providing the bipolar function and the electrically conductive path. 

31 

 
 
 
 
Figure 18 Fuel Cell Repeat Elements and Bi Polar Plates 

The challenge in utilizing thin metal plates for flow fields lies in sealing the hardware 
when stacked such that the gaps created by the lack of thickness in the BPP are filled 
with a sealing material. If utilizing an adhesive approach for stack assembly then this 
gap area, seen in Figure 19, both seals and adheres the repeat elements together. 

Figure 19 Fuel Cell Repeat Elements and Associated Sealing 

The Infinity UAS fuel cell product development approach will be to minimize the number 
of part numbers required in building the fuel cell stack while also minimizing the total 
number of parts required. This is standard practice in high volume industries and one 
that will serve the UAS market pricing demands well.  

3.4.3.1 Fuel Cell Bipolar Plate Sealing Approach 
A goal of the UAS fuel cell is low cost in production. Per vendor quotes obtained during 
this project it became known that the joining of metal plate elements in forming BPPs 
represented up to a full third of the overall cost of fabrication. Generally, for metal BPPs 
the bonding method of choice is welding. 

To reduce this cost, an approach was attempted to join the two-part bipolar plate by a 
different approach.  Instead of welding, the metal plates comprising the BPP were 
planned to be compressed against one another during the assembly process, remaining 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
in constant contact during operation. Historical fuel cell operating evidence suggests 
corrosion may be an issue in this configuration, however the expected lifetime of the 
current product being developed should be the limiting factor when fielded.  

To make the compressed BPP concept viable, a sealing methodology was required to 
both contain reactants in the active area of each cell (internal to the stack) while 
preventing incoming reactants to the stack via external manifolds from entering the 
active areas. This seal must be of a low durometer to effect proper sealing and must 
also be integral to each part being assembled. Managing very thin O-rings during the 
assembly of multi-cell fuel cell stacks would be extremely cumbersome. These 
requirements have led to the development of Form-In-Place (FIP) gaskets for use in 
development of this product. The sealing material in this case is critical and must 
interact well with hydrogen and possibly pure oxygen.  

There are several manufacturers of FIP gasket material. These materials span a fairly 
large durometer range, see Figure 20, however this development project will require 
materials at the lower end of the scale in the “Soft” range. This will allow for 
approximately 25% to 30% compression of the gasket material with little overall force 
required during assembly compared to the force requirement for the GDL. 

3.4.4 Fuel Cell Stack Architecture 

Figure 20 Shore Hardness Scales 

The overall design of the fuel cell stack incorporates cost effective approaches to 
manufacturing individual cell components for achieving a lightweight design. To meet 
the challenges of the drone environment the design team has attempted to minimize 
balance of system (BOS) components, allowing for multi-tasking components as 
appropriate. As seen in Figure 21, the original fuel cell stack concept allowed for a 
single fan to pull ambient coolant air through the active fuel cell stack hardware, thus 
providing a pre-heated coolant air outlet from which to draw reactant supply for fuel cell 
operation. This pre-heating is an advantage when operating at higher, and colder, 
altitudes as moisture in the very cold incoming air could condense within the stack, 

33 

 
 
 
 
causing performance issues. The potential inclusion of this performance improvement 
has been postponed for now pending the outcome of testing without it.  

Additionally, with major markets in mind for this fuel cell product flying at or below a 400 
ft altitude, the inclusion of pre-heated reactant air is far less necessary. Therefore, the 
initial design was focused on a two-fan approach: one larger fan for thermal control and 
one smaller fan for reactant air delivery. The additional parasitic loss over a broad range 
of operating conditions is compensated by the increased simplicity in the overall system 
architecture.  

Figure 21  UAS Fuel Cell Stack Preliminary Air Flow Scheme 

The externally manifolded approach not only provides a lower cost part, but it also 
allows for further integration into airframes in the future. Presently most airframes – 
fixed wing and multirotor – are designed independently of the power system. Power 
system components are certainly accounted for in terms of mounting and operation, but 
airframe design and power system design are mutually exclusive operations. Removing 
the external manifolds from the fuel cell stack and inserting directly into the fuselage, 
utilizing the fuselage as the external manifolds, could provide complete integration of 
airframe and power system, thereby further reducing the cost and increasing the 
efficiency of the entire drone platform. This opportunity may be explored further in the 
future. 

3.4.5 Control System Approach 

The complete control system adheres to the state diagram shown in Figure 22. The full 
fuel cell stack will be free of individual cell voltage taps to minimize I/O count. Stack 
voltage will be measured and assessed relative to theoretical values based upon 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
measured current and calculated current density. Since this is a hybrid battery/fuel cell 
system, each energy producing subsystem will be monitored and assessed during 
startup, run, and shutdown. Shutdown and safing of the fuel cell will be done when input 
parameters demand it. Fuel cell air input will be driven through a control algorithm 
derived from the single cell testing already performed to determine variable airflow 
across the full breadth of the power band while not allowing an oversupply of air, as this 
would be detrimental to stack performance (causes membrane dryout).  

Figure 22 UML State Diagram 

35 

 
 
 
 
The states defined for the system, per Unified Modeling Language (UML), illustrate 
system status. Between each state several activities must take place and these will be 
defined per a system activity diagram. The controls algorithms are being developed per 
the state diagram, the activity diagram (still under development), and sub routines 
developed during single cell testing. An electrical schematic is in work and will be 
completed in parallel with control system development. A Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) will be employed for monitoring and control of the integrated benchtop testing. 
This will allow for greater ease in visual assessment of all I/O outside of more 
cumbersome code viewers. 

Next steps will be ordering a full complement of fuel cell stack materials and preparing 
for a full stack build. A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) will be performed 
once the complete electrical schematic is finished and this will lead into the completion 
of the compliance matrix study. MEAs will be fabricated while waiting for final BPP 
tooling to arrive. Once tooling is received, the BPPs will be fabricated and the sealing 
solution applied. Stack containment in the form of 3D printed manifolds will be obtained 
prior to full stack build and the lightweight fuel cell will then be assembled, with system 
integration following shortly thereafter.  

3.4.6 Balance of System Architecture 

System hardware has been kept to a minimum part count to reduce both mass and 
volume while maintaining all necessary controls and I/O for safe operation, see Figure 
23. Much of the inlet hardware indicated in the P&ID is included in the regulator Infinity 
will be acquiring, including the fill port, burst disc, pressure transducer, and pressure 
gauge. Leveraging this purpose-built regulator has reduced the mass of these individual 
components significantly. This version of the P&ID includes both the reactant air blower 
and the cooling fan (attached to the fuel cell stack).

3.5 Certification Compliance Review: Part 25 Regulations  

Building on the work of the Energy Supply Device Aviation Rulemaking Committee 
(ESD ARC) Infinity is mapping the ARC recommendations for applicable parts of the 
regulations as they apply both to a generic fuel cell system and to the UAV fuel cell 
system currently under development. The goal of the document under development is to 
provide a detailed framework for qualification of a generic fuel cell system for a Part 25 
application.  To do this the document will summarize a review of the UAV fuel cell as if it 
were to be qualified under Part 25. This will highlight which Part 25 regulations can 
practically be met by the UAV design and which require substantial additions or 
modifications. The basis for this is the current draft ARC document. The UAV fuel cell 
design is being reviewed with respect to each subpart regulation identified in the ARC 
draft along with relevant Advisory Circulars. Each subpart will be addressed with a 
separate analysis that considers both manned transport and unmanned applications 
and details how compliance with the regulation may be achieved.

4.1.1 Air Flow Testing 

As outlined above, a primary goal of developing the targeted UAS fuel cell power 
system is to meet application requirements with a cost-effective product.  Optimization 
of the air flow scheme is an important consideration in achieving that objective. 
Opportunity exists to leverage the incoming air flow to the UAS fuel cell power system 
for both cooling and reactant air, while also preheating the reactant air. Managing the 
split air flow stream, however, can become challenging. The cooling air requirement 
must be maintained at varying power levels while the reactant air stoichiometry must be 
sufficient for efficient power generation.  

In order to test the single air flow concept, test hardware was acquired and a 
representative chamber was constructed, see Figure 24, to duplicate a manifolded fuel 
cell concept. The chamber dimensions seen in the figure are not critical; the 
measurement of air flow through each of two exiting paths via a singular control is 
representative of the multi-chamber concept. The chamber itself was constructed from 
plasticized corrugated board. Hot wire anemometer wind speed sensors (Modern 
Devices) were placed at locations 3 and 4 (see diagram). A 200-cfm fan was positioned 

38 

 
 
 
 
at location 1 and a louvered sliding door was positioned between locations 2 and 4 
(represented by bold dashed line in diagram). 

Figure 24 Airflow Testing Setup 

During operation in the completed product it was planned that the required fan would be 
pulse width modulation (PWM) controlled. To begin the development of this type of 
system, a control board (Arduino) was acquired and programmed to operate the fan 
based on a feedback control loop from the wind speed sensors. A series of air flow 
measurements were taken and converted to cfm ratings at locations 3 and 4. The 
resulting data for varying combinations of open and closed conditions at locations 3 and 
4 can be seen in Figure 25. Although the fan rating was 200 cfm, the maximum 
attainable flow from the test article was approximately 72 cfm (leftmost chart in figure), 
assuming original formulas provided by vendor. The wind sensors were also tested in a 
wind tunnel at Western New England University (WNEU) and the formulas developed 
through the course of that testing yielded a potential 121 cfm combined flow rate from 
both AFS 3 and 4. This 121 cfm rate would correspond to a pressure in the chamber of 
approximately 10 mm H2O (0.014 psig)26, see Figure 26. The lower flow rate through 
the test article was due to the large pressure differential within the test article and the 
inability of the test fan to overcome it.

Figure 25 Air Flow Test Results 

The concept system would ideally be configured such that air flow sensors would 
provide feedback to either a one or two 
fan system to establish more efficient 
control of air flow to the stack. One of the 
key takeaways from this testing is the 
wide gap in reduction formulas necessary 
to implement an economical hot wire 
anemometer for this purpose. Further 
literature and internet reviews of other 
experimentation with similarly priced hot 
wire anemometers revealed similar 
difficulties in both calibration and end 
results as that experienced by the Infinity 
team. The challenge of choosing the 
appropriate fan is exacerbated by the 
imposed requirement of powering the fan 
from the 24 VDC output of the fuel cell 
stack with little or no modification through 
buck/boost conversion. 

Figure 26 Air Flow vs Pressure 

Given the restrictive manifold environment of the edge feed fuel cell it was determined 
that it would   be necessary to specify a fan with much greater flow capacity at pressure. 
Utilizing a compressor or blower would suffice as well, however these components are 
often higher cost. A quick comparison of other fan offerings, Figure 27, illustrates the 
difference in fan blade designs which may improve overall performance and provide 
proper airflow for either cooling or reactant air. Based on test results and further 
evaluation, a two-fan approach was initially selected, with one fan providing coolant air 

40 

 
 
 
 
 
and a second fan providing reactant air. Although adding more parts to the final product, 
the resultant efficiency in air delivery in both modes was determined to be a benefit. 
Further developments in the overall stack and system, as detailed below required 
redesign of this airflow concept for the initial implementation of the architecture, but it 
remains highly attractive for selected applications. 

Figure 27 Fan Comparison: Test Article (L), High Static Pressure (M), High Flow (R) 

4.1.1.1 Air Flow Measurement 
To provide ultimate efficiency in the delivery of air in the two-fan approach, the 
implementation of a feedback loop via air flow sensors would be desirable. Further 
investigation into air flow sensing reveals several options and price points, Table 10. 
Inexpensive devices, like the one tested, require more correction than devices with 
significantly higher price points. The higher price usually puts the device out of reach for 
commercial product development. A cost benefit analysis is underway to determine the 

Table 10 Comparison of Various Air Flow Sensing Devices 

efficacy of applying air flow measurement versus simple correlation of fan speed to 
static pressure and required air flow. A simple correlation made for stoichiometric 
condition versus fan speed and PWM control via Arduino or Raspberry Pi controller for 
reactant air flow and coolant air required would suffice. 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
4.1.1.2 Air Flow Temperature Measurement 
The temperature of the air stream was inherently measured during air flow testing as 
part of utilizing a hot wire anemometer. In practice it would be beneficial to monitor the 
outgoing, and possibly incoming, reactant and cooling air streams. Since the final 
design of this product will employ a two-fan system; one for reactant air and one for 
coolant air, the ability to control PWM settings for the particular fan employed for that 
stream. This operating paradigm may provide benefit in reducing parasitic power draw 
from the drone’s power and energy system, thus increasing available energy for longer 
flight times.  

Table 11 Temperature Sensor Comparison 

A general review of available temperature sensing technologies yields the standard cast 
of characters typically used in the fuel cell community, see Table 11. Generally, 
thermocouples are convenient for use in lab testing given their fast response times; cost 
is typically an issue. For the development of this low-cost fuel cell-based power product, 
the Infinity team will be assessing the cost of temperature sensing to trade against the 
need for such measurement and control. 

4.1.1.3 Airflow: IP Rating of Air Infiltration System 
Since the drone being powered by the fuel cell system will eventually navigate airspace 
with inclement weather, it is desirous that any incoming air be free of water and debris. 
An oxygen or bottled air supply to the fuel cell would certainly preclude any introduction 
of debris into the fuel cell system, however, utilizing the air intake function through 
various altitudes will invariably draw water into the system. Furthermore, with the fuel 
cell stack being air cooled, the necessity to power the separate cooling fan will always 
be an issue when considering water infiltration. Filter media will play a role in managing 
debris and water infiltration. Proper Ingress Protection (IP). ratings of electrical 
components will prevent component failure in operation. 

42 

 
 
 
 
Many Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components are available in a variety of IP 
ratings. Fans, blowers, etc. can be acquired to meet most environmental situations. 
Figure 28 illustrates the range of IP ratings for electrical components to be operated in 
the field. Providing dust and water protection to all electrical components of the fuel cell 
power system is critical in flight. The targeted minimum IP rating for fuel cell electrical 
components is IP54: Dust protected; Protected against water splashing from any angle. 

Figure 28 IP Ratings Chart 

4.1.1.4 Cathode Blower Evaluation 
Three blowers were acquired that will meet the cathode airflow requirements of the fuel 
cell stack under development and evaluated with respect to airflow, vibration, cost, 
control requirements, and voltage requirements. These were primarily qualitative tests 
and meant to properly define the correct option for inclusion in the final product. Table 
12 illustrates the overall findings. 

The ultimate cathode feed blower for the fuel cell product will be the Nidec model given 
its broad airflow and pressure capabilities. Further, the lifetime of the blower is 
significant compared to others in the same market. The manufacturer claims to have 
one of these blowers on life test (at zero back pressure) for the past 11 years.  

43 

 
 
 
 
Table 12 Cathode Feed Options 

Both San Ace blowers may satisfy cooling fan/blower requirements for the fuel cell, 
however, the 200 g unit was determined to be too heavy to meet performance 
specifications. The dual fan may meet both pressure and flow for cooling requirements.  

4.1.2 Bi Polar Plate Fabrication 

To better understand the rubber pad forming process, and assess its viability for the 
current development program, a 3-D printed plastic version of the tooling die was made 
and used in conjunction with varying durometer urethane pads. This go/no-go testing 
yielded partial pressings of the metal foil, but also proved the concept for further 
evaluation. Figure 29 shows the original pressing test setup and one of the resultant 
metal sheet pressings. Note the feature detail in the image. Although specified depth 
was not attained during the press operation, the feature development alone provided 
reason enough to move forward with additional testing. 

44 

 
 
 
 
Figure 29 Go/No-Go Rubber Pad Press Test and Associated Formed Part 

The next step in evaluating this forming process was the acquisition of a harder tool. In 
this case, although considered soft tooling, a forming tool was fabricated from aluminum 
and combined with pad containment and a press plate, see Figure 30. The pressing 
operation was limited by the available 50-ton hydraulic press located at Infinity’s facility. 
Several press runs over several weeks were performed, including both contained and 
uncontained, known as “free pad”, compressions. In contained mode, the urethane pads 
used as the press “fluid” must be houses within a depression in the tooling to prevent 
lateral movement. Literature suggests this will provide more pressing force per unit area 
into the part being formed. Testing proved it is rather difficult to contain the pad’s lateral 
forces with built-up tooling; rather, a dedicated female tool is required, and in practice 
this will increase first costs of acquiring tooling. Free pad presses were also performed 
on the 50-ton press (rightmost image in Figure 30). 

Figure 30 Soft Tooling for Rubber Pad Press Testing 

The results from this in-house press testing (Figure 31) illustrate several unique 
challenges to the operation and during the course of testing many variations to the 
pressing operation were attempted, including pad durometer, press force, and free/fixed 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
pad. The images represent early to later pressings and demonstrate increasing feature 
fidelity. The specified dimensions of the part, however, were never fully achieved. After 
exhausting all options for in-house pressing, the Infinity team approached an outside 
supplier to solicit advice and produce test samples of the formed flow field on their 
hydraulic presses. The general consensus among the Infinity team was that the in-
house press was simply not large enough to provide the force required. The rightmost 
image in Figure 31 is a sample pressed at rather low press force but utilizing a very 
thick urethane pad at the vendor’s facility. This pressing was the best yet, but still did 
not meet depth specifications. Pressing attempts at up to 400 tons did not solve the 
depth issue. Interestingly, the rightmost press image was performed at only 50 tons and 
yielded the greatest feature fidelity. 

Figure 31 Rubber Pad Formed Flow Field Part Testing 

After further discussions with the forming vendor it was suggested that the forming of 
such a complex part may require the use of both a positive and a negative tool, similar 
to the stamping process but a soft tool rather than a hard tool, with rubber pad place on 
top of the two-die set when forming the part. This hybrid process is the method of 
choice when performing rubber pad pressing of metal parts at the vendor’s facility. 

4.1.2.1 Open vs. Closed Cathode  
Overall control of the fuel within the system is highly dependent on how the fuel cell is 
being fed reactant. The hydrogen feed to the fuel cell is well established and is 
controlled through the regulator. The air into the fuel cell can be fed through either an 
open or closed cathode flow field design. An open cathode fuel cell utilizes a flow-
through air flow field, allowing for low resistance, high velocity air to flow into the fuel 
cell and react quickly with the catalyzed membrane.  These flow fields are characterized 
by low pressure drops and typically shorter flow field channels. 

Conversely, a closed cathode serpentine flow channel provides longer channel lengths, 
and therefore larger back pressures across the channels, allowing for better water 
removal, Figure 33. The increased backpressure, however, requires more powerful air-
moving equipment, which typically increases overall mass and volume of the complete 
fuel cell system. Both flow field arrangements were evaluated during final full-scale 
single cell testing to determine effects on both fuel cell and system performance.  

46 

 
 
 
 
Through several iterations of test hardware and operating parameters it was determined 
that an open cathode design would be employed for the initial prototype due to better 
performance when combined with the MEA Infinity is presently assembling for this 
program. The open cathode, or straight-through flow field, will be coupled with the 
serpentine flow field for anode (hydrogen) flow. This arrangement tested well during trial 
runs of full-scale single cell hardware.

Open Cathode Performance Impact Summary 

While the open cathode provides benefits of simplicity, lower, cost and weight these 
benefits tradeoff against potential benefits of closed cathode air or O2 systems.  These 
include: 

•  Performance: O2 partial pressure  
•  Altitude limitations  
•  Dry out/wet up operational envelope design 
Performance:  
The hydrogen-oxygen reaction is positively correlated to oxygen partial pressure 
meaning performance in terms of watts/cell also increases as O2 partial pressure 
increases.  The open cathode H2-air system inherently limits the ability to increase O2 
partial pressure since it essentially operates at ambient or near ambient pressure.  A 
closed cathode H2-air system provides the ability to pressurize the cathode, 
increasing the O2 partial pressure thereby increasing performance.  A closed cathode 
H2-O2 system provides the highest performance per cell area.  However, each of 
these increases in performance must in-turn be traded off against potential increases 
in system complexity, weight and cost. 

Altitude 
One key factor in selection of an open or close cathode is the required altitude  of 
intended application.  Since O2 partial pressure decreases with altitude performance 
also decreases with altitude.  Designers must trade off altitude capability against 
closed cathode system factors.  At very low altitudes an open cathode may be an 
excellent choice.  As altitude increases, closed cathode-pressurized  systems start to  
provide better overall tradeoffs.  As altitude increases to the point where O2 partial 
pressure is near or at zero, oxygen systems are required            

Dry-out, Wet-up and Cooling  Design Issues 
Other factors related to open vs. closed cathode decisions include maintenance of 
proper water balance and proper cooling. The open cathode air flow typically provides 
both oxygen reactant and cooling air flow.  The H2-O2 reaction produces  water in 
addition to power.  The product water that is produced must be removed but not all of 
it. Enough of the water produced by the reaction is  required  to be retained in the 
MEA internal structure to allow the reaction to proceed.  Also, since cooling in an open 
cathode is usually is accomplished via air flow enough air must be provided to 
maintain thermal balance, as well as O2 supply and water removal.  However if too 
much air flow is provided the cell may dry out reducing performance.  The design must 
balance and control these factors  to provide required performance.

4.1.3 Bipolar Plate Process 

Thin metallic plates being formed onsite for use as fuel cell flow fields has been the goal 
of this program from the beginning. Mass savings experienced due to small, thin, foil-
based plates is required for integration into UAS airframes and further market adoption. 
Several challenges were encountered during early prototyping phases, leading to 
material upgrades and process changes to better form the required plates. Figure 34 
illustrates an updated metal BPP forming process developed over the course of this 
project and is now being implemented at Infinity’s facility.  

Figure 34 Flow Field Fabrication Process 

All flow fields required for one complete fuel cell stack build have been through first 
press, annealing, and second press. Four samples (2 anode, 2 cathode) have been 
plated and sealed, see Figure 35 for example of each. The plating process is nickel-
based and designed for stainless steel components in commercial markets where price-
sensitivity is of prime concern. Initial conductivity measurements, prior to single cell 
testing, indicate that this plating process may not be appropriate for fuel cell use. These 
nickel-plated flow fields will be used in functional single cell testing to determine efficacy 
of the plating. Other plating options have been explored and are currently being 
assessed further in parallel with single cell testing of finalized fuel cell components.

4.1.4 Sealing Material Testing 

Utilizing materials in the Shore 00-65 to A-35, Infinity performed preliminary testing of 
possible stack sealing materials in association with a local manufacturer. This FIP 
material was deposited on sample 316 stainless steel strips using a pneumatic 
applicator and then cured using a UV-A light across varying application widths and cure 
times. Figure 36 is a representative example of test samples of gasket material that was 
deposited, cured, and pressed to varying thicknesses, some of which were brought to 
failure. 

Figure 36 FIP Gasket Material Test Samples 

All testing was performed with knowledge of, and use of, the formulas derived for such 
products per the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D395, Test 
Method B. See figure 37 for formula definitions. 

figure 37 Seal Material Testing Definitions 

Figure 38 represents a cross sectional view of the applied gasket with respect to an 
embedded gasket groove on a fully formed BPP. 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 38 Mechanical Property Definitions for Seal Material in Sealing Groove 

The test effort on the sealing material confirmed data as suggested on data sheets of 
each material. Compression set, as seen in Table 13, closely approximates theoretical. 
Furthermore, it was learned that these results could be obtained over a fairly wide range 
of application variables.  

Table 13 FIP Gasket Material Sample Testing 

Once all flow fields are plated, they are returned to Infinity for deposition of sealing 
material. Infinity has invested in an FIP gasket machine, see Figure 39, outside of this 
program for use in applying sealing material across all of its fuel cell stack components. 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 39 Robotic Dispensing System for Seal Application 

Each flow field in this design configuration requires sealing on at least one surface once 
the part is plated. The anode flow field is sealed on two sides; the cathode flow field is 
sealed on one side only. In addition to sealing the flow fields, each manifold is sealed on 
one side, providing a gasket between the manifold and the side of the fuel cell stack. 
The process for applying seals to one side of a flow field is shown in Figure 40. The flow 
field sealing process is as follows: 1) Prepare fixture to receive flow field; 2) Align flow 
field plate; 3) Apply magnetic hold-down to secure plate to fixture; 4) Dispense sealing 
material; 5) An additional step after seal application is the UV cure, which follows the 
same path as the applied sealing material. 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 40 Robotic Dispensing of Sealing Material on Flow Field 

Seal placement on the formed plates has been designed to achieve proper gasketing to 
contain reactant and prevent leakage into the opposite flow field during operation. The 
critical locations for gasketing are the H2 inlet and outlet regions. These gasket regions 
are crucial to keep the hydrogen contained within the anode flow field and sealed 
against the appropriate manifold sections. Establishing the dispensing path both at the 
edge of the plate and inboard, forming a parallel run of sealing material, is critical in 
providing stable compression and leak-free operation. 

Figure 41 Anode Flow Field Channel and Sealing Detail 

Once sealed, flow fields are stacked to form BPPs and combined with MEAs to form 
repeat elements within a complete fuel cell stack embodiment. 

4.1.4 MEA Fabrication and Test 

In order to achieve a low-cost factor in the current fuel cell stack design, the exploration 
of in-house manufacturing of MEAs is required. The first step to locking in a final 
encapsulated MEA design is to finalize parameters for the hot-pressing of the Gas 
Diffusion Electrode (GDE) to the raw Nafion membrane. This 5-layer MEA will then be 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placed within a laminated plastic frame, providing both a sealing surface and hard stop 
for assembly. 

4.1.4.1 Coupon Samples – Initial Fabrication and Testing 
To determine optimal parameters for hot-pressing the GDE and Nafion, multiple tests 
and press iterations were conducted using a 12 cm2 single cell stack developed at 
WNEU, Figure 42. Due to its small size, it allowed for quick turn-around times in terms 
of hardware setups, builds, disassembles, etc. and kept material cost to a minimum. 
The serpentine flow channels for the stack are machined into graphite plates, with a 1 
mm2 square channel geometry for the cathode and 1 mm x 0.8 mm channel geometry 
on the anode side. 

Figure 42 WNEU 12 cm2 Single Cell and Hot Pressed MEA 

The experimental setup used in the hot press procedure for MEAs consisted of an in-
house hydraulic press, machined hot press platens, and heater control boxes to 
regulate platen temperature. Figure 43 shows this experimental setup, with hot press 
platens mounted to the hydraulic press and heater cartridge control boxes to the right. 
All of the 12 cm2 MEAs for testing were assembled on this setup, as well as future 
MEAs to be used in the final 90 cm2 stack. 

54 

 
 
 
 
Figure 43 MEA Hot Press 

Parameters such as temperature and pressure were adjusted for each MEA build and 
test, and a baseline of 2 minutes per press was followed. Tests were conducted on both 
papers based and cloth-based GDE. Multiple hot-press temperatures and pressures 
were tested by running each hot-pressed MEA through a number of polarization curves. 
Table 14 provides an overview of hot press parameters for each test. 

Figure 44 shows the fuel cell lab testing station (on loan from Infinity Fuel Cell) at 

Table 14 Hot Pressing Parameters by Test ID 

WNEU. This test setup was used to conduct break-in procedures on newly assembled 
MEAs along with collecting performance data from polarization curves for comparison 
and characterization. A heater control box-maintained fuel cell temperature at 70°C and 
the Scribner 850C test stand pre-heated the reactant gasses to that same 70°C. 
Hydrogen and air were used as reactant gasses in order to mimic conditions that the 
full-scale fuel cell will be subject to. The 12 cm2 stack was brought online with a 
preliminary nitrogen purge for 20 minutes, followed by either wet or dry reactant gas. A

dry startup was performed for MEA test A-3 and every subsequent test thereafter in 
order to once again mimic real-world operating conditions. 

Figure 44 WNEU Fuel Cell Lab Testing Station 

The data in Figure 45 illustrates the results of the MEA testing. Based on these 
polarization curves, it can be seen that as pressing temperature increased, so did the 
performance of the cell. It was concluded that the temperature has a stronger role in 
good adhesion and bonding between the membrane and GDE rather than pressure. 
The far extremes for pressure and temperature were not explored in this testing matrix, 
as schedule limitations are a controlling factor; however further testing and research will 
be conducted as an internal research and development activity to determine the points 
of diminishing return for each parameter. The 2-minute press time also remained 
unchanged throughout the tests, and is another variable that will need to be explored in 
further research. 

56 

 
 
 
 
Figure 45 Polarization Curves for Each Hot Pressed MEA Test 

From the data presented, A-1 and A-5 provided the most favorable performance 
characteristics, most likely due to the properties of the GDL material employed. The 
early onset of the concentration loss region of the POL curve for A-1 were likely due to 
over-compression in the GDL, leading to reactant gas flow restriction. By reducing the 
compressive pressure used during the hot press, much higher performance was 
achieved as seen in the A-5 test data. Further testing is planned to find the maximum 
performance curve with respect to hot-press pressure, however for the purposes of 
current product development, scaled up estimates using A-5 data show adequate 
performance while still maintaining performance margin. 

4.1.4.2 Full Scale MEA Prototyping & Manufacturing Preparation 
In parallel with MEA coupon testing, preliminary plastic frame material testing was 
performed. Matching material thickness to GDL thickness is of prime importance when 
developing an air-breathing MEA. Early testing involved proper lamination of plastic and 
adhesive layers to form the appropriate lamination around the Nafion® and GDL 
materials. 

MEA assembly steps have been established and prototype manufacturing tooling files 
and drawings have been created. As seen in Figure 46, the assembly process for a fully 
configured MEA includes layup of soft materials, hot pressing of these soft goods, layup 
of hot pressed soft goods within a layup of hard frame materials, and rolling of all layers. 
This is a generally well-established process within the fuel cell community. However, the 

57 

 
 
 
 
unique aspect for Infinity, and all companies employing it, is in the particular material 
and process recipes developed. For Infinity, the goal in processing MEAs onsite was 
cost reduction. The performance of these MEAs, discussed elsewhere in this report, 
was acceptable for further development of fuel cell power systems for drones.  

Figure 46 PEMFC MEA Manufacturing Process 

Initial full scale MEA fabrication was completed utilizing in-house hot press, die cutting 
press, and steel rule dies, Figure 47, for cutting various soft and hard goods. While this 

Figure 47 Steel Rule Dies for MEA Fabrication 

early processing suffices for the initial development, a midterm solution is necessary for 
full scale low volume production. To this end, a Mobile Manufacturing Cart (MMC) 
concept has been envisioned by the Infinity team, Figure 48. This assembly cart is 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
designed to hold all materials and tools used in the assembly of MEAs in roll form, while 
providing the convenience of navigating between pressing and cutting stations within 
the Infinity facility. This may provide a convenient intermediate platform for future 
production needs. 

Figure 48 Mobile PEMFC MEA Manufacturing Cart 

First assembly of full scale MEAs proved to be challenging. The first full scale MEA 
(FS1) was assembled entirely according to the process developed prior. The soft goods 
comprised of the Nafion membrane and the Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) were hot 
pressed separately and then place within hard plastic framing materials during 
assembly. The GDE is comprised of GDL material with a catalyst applied to one side 
ready for hot pressing. Unfortunately, during the assembly process the hot-pressed soft 
goods moved underneath elements of the hard-plastic framing material, producing 
ridges at the GDL/frame interface, see Figure 49. This ridge prevents complete contact 
between the flow field and the GDL which will reduce electrical conductivity in the cell, 
resulting in poor performance; some of these ridges can be seen on the left side of the 
image. The black area in the center of the MEA is the active area comprised of the 
membrane, GDLs, and catalyst layers. The outer white colored perimeter is the hard-
plastic frame comprised of multiple layers of thin plastic and adhesive. The overall size 
of the frame is much larger than the final product and is designed to fit within the two 
stainless steel halves of the single cell test article.  

59 

 
 
 
 
Figure 49 Full Scale MEA First Fab (FS1) 

An additional full-scale hot press attempt was made after FS1. The process for 
manufacturing FS2 was changed slightly in that the soft goods were dry fit along with 
the hard goods and hot pressed as an entire assembly. This was done to accommodate 
a simpler assembly process at the expense of providing a lower pressure and 
temperature to all the components during the hot press. The resultant MEA is shown in 
Figure 50 and represents a much better press, with no overlapping and ridges. 

Figure 50 Full Scale MEA Second Fab (FS2) 

These full scale MEAs have undergone testing in single cell hardware to prove out 
performance of the MEA itself, as well as the flow field design chosen for this 
application. 

Full Scale Testing - Initial 

Prior to ordering tooling and material for a complete fuel cell stack, a full scale, 90 cm2, 
single cell has been tested under the same conditions as the coupon tests. To minimize 
variables during this testing, and maximize obtained test data, robust 316 stainless steel 

60 

 
 
 
 
 
flow field plates have been acquired which have reactant flow channels machined in 
place to Infinity’s specifications, see Figure 51. Testing will be iterative, as necessary, to 
prove out the flow field design, which will then be incorporated into the ultimate metal 
foil BPP design and tooling. 

Figure 51 Full Scale Single Cell Flow Field Plates 

Initial testing of the full scale MEAs discussed earlier was not successful. Since both 
MEAs (FS1, FS2) were compromised, good results were not expected across the 
entirety of a polarization curve. Also, flow rates were not well established for this 
particular design, leading to what is believed to have been dry out of the membrane. 
There were no failures of components during testing, however, startup of the fuel cells 
was never fully achieved due to lack of wet up across the MEA. Wetting up the 
membrane is critical to fuel cell performance, as water is necessary to achieve the 
electrochemical process.  

Coupon Testing – Final 

Through the course of initial coupon tests flow schemes and rates were established for 
each cell and compared to initial design analyses. The final set of coupon tests were 
utilized for startup evaluation of the MEA, as well as comparison to competitor’s 
products. Figure 52 indicates performance of various coupon tests run both with and 
without humidification of the MEA during initial startup. The A5 version of the coupon 
test dominates over performance of similar membranes hot pressed at various 
pressures. A5 also performs above competitor A (listed in the figure as COMP A), 
yielding sufficient voltage and current density to satisfy the power objectives of this 
program.  

61 

 
 
 
 
Figure 52 Second Round of Coupon Testing 

All of the coupon testing was done using a Scribner fuel cell test station with electronic 
load and mass flow controllers. Humidification of the reactants was eventually turned off 
over the course of testing to simulate a dry start of the fuel cell (as would be the case for 
fuel cells produced in volume). One issue with the test station, however, was the 
introduction of water vapor through the test station plumbing, thus yielding slightly 
humidified reactant when the non-humidified reactant option was selected. Since testing 
of the ultimate fuel cell product will require dry reactant inlet conditions, dead ended 
anode (DEA), and blower supplied air, we began weaning the small-scale testing from 
direct test station reactant feed during this second round of testing. 

DEA operation of the fuel cell in the field is the norm for other hydrogen/air PEMFCs, as 
this allows for hydrogen to be available at the catalyzed membrane for immediate 
uptake of load. DEA operation, however, requires periodic purging of the anode during 
operation, particularly when running on ambient air as nitrogen will diffuse across the 
MEA and accumulate in the anode. This purging serves to remove anodic 
contaminants, thus increasing performance of the fuel cell. Purging also increases 
hydrogen consumption slightly, driving the stoichiometric rate above 1.

Figure 53 Miniature Cathode Feed Blower with Arduino PWM Control 

Cathode side air supplied by a small blower in the ultimate fuel cell product will need to 
conform to predetermined stoichiometric rates during startup and variable load 
operation. Further, the supply of ambient air can vary depending on altitude and local 
quality. To better duplicate the operation of the fuel cell in the field, the Nidec blower 
discussed earlier was employed during lab testing. PWM control of the blower during 
early testing was performed manually given the very low flow rates we were running on 
the 12cm2 test article. For larger active area testing, a control algorithm was employed 
for PWM control via an Arduino based controller to establish proper stoichiometry over a 
broad range of operation, see Figure 53.  

The chart in Figure 54 illustrates one of our last tests, A9, for which we utilized the fuel 
cell station for its electronic load capability only; relying on hydrogen fed directly from a 
tank to satisfy DEA, and blower supplied cathode air. The figure indicates reasonable 
performance over a standard polarization curve under the listed conditions. Also shown 
are respectable cathode stoichiometric rates. Based on previous testing, the parasitic 
losses associated with higher cathode flow rates provided by the blower are negligible.

Figure 54 Coupon Test of Dry Anode Feed and Blower Supplied Cathode Air 

After completion of this final round of coupon testing, a full scale MEA was hot pressed 
and assembled in the single cell hardware for performance testing. As with the first 
round of full-scale testing, this next phase helped the team determine the performance 
of the flow field design prior to placement of the order for BPP forming dies. 

4.1.5 Fuel Cell Short Stack Development Manufacturing and Test  

The fuel cell stack combines all of the elements discussed above: 

•  MEA 
•  Bipolar Plate 
•  Sealing 
•  Coating   
•  Reactant Flow  

Into one functional unit able to receive reactants and generate power. The pathway to 
development of this stack is to design and build single cell/and or short stack hardware 
then increase the number of cells to the required full prototype design once short stack 
testing confirms proper operation.  

64 

 
 
 
 
The integration of these individual components into an operating stack is often the most 
challenging stage of a new fuel cell system. The stack brings together electrical, 
chemical, mechanical, fluidic, thermal and other factors into one functional subsystem.   

This section details the initial design approach and results of short stack fabrication and 
test and modifications required to support full scale prototype manufacturing and test. 

4.1.5.1 Initial Stack design and manufacture approach 
The nominal fuel cell stack voltage was established by the requirements as a 28 VDC 
average output over its lifecycle. Lifetime of the stack itself was estimated to be 
between 1,500 and 2,000 hours. To meet these requirements the fuel cell stack, see 
Figure 55, is configured as an edge-fed, 50 cell, 90 cm2 active area, product with a 
design maximum output power rating of 1.5 kW. While single cell testing to date had 
been performed with actual MEA configurations using machined plates, fully formed thin 
metallic foil flow fields were planned to be tested together with the final MEA 
configuration as part of the stack development testing. Modifications to materials and 
processing would be made as necessary based on these tests. 

Figure 55 Single Cell Test Platform Leading to Full Scale Stack 

The initial design stack was to have all stackable hardware held together with 2-3 metal 
bands running around the outer surface of all components. This is a proven, cost-
effective method for securing all components in a stacked configuration while also 
providing adequate internal compression for the Gas Diffusion Layers and providing 
proper electrical conductivity through the fuel cell stack.  A similar configuration is used 
by various other fuel cell stack manufacturers. 

65 

 
 
 
 
 
A simple fixture (left side of Figure 56) was developed to allow the components to self-
align in a corner while being placed on the stack. This fixture allows the straps to be 
applied and tensioned while the stack components are in the stacking fixture.  

The compression strapping of the fuel cell is an easily reproduced assembly method 
that lends itself to larger volume production. The strap is made of stainless steel, cut to 
length, and held tight with a clip. The strap has approximately 1 inch folded back over 
onto itself. It is passed through the clip, allowing the bent-over portion to lay outside the 
clip on its bottom face. The strap is then passed around the stack and passed back 
through the clip (middle of Figure 56). The tensioning tool (right side of Figure 56) is 
then attached and the handle is screwed down, applying tension to the strap. When full 
tension is achieved, the tensioning tool is moved to fold the strap back over the clip. 

The hydrogen inlet and outlet manifolds can be seen in Figure 56 (M) as the plastic 

Figure 56 Stack Assembly Fixture, Assembled Single Cell, and Tensioning Tool (R) 

components containing three bosses each. All the plastic hardware – 2 end plates and 2 
manifolds – were 3D printed in ABS plastic. While the end plates are held in place by 
the aforementioned metal straps, the manifolds are held in place with small diameter 
threaded rod running the length of each side of both end plates and acorn nuts.  

4.1.5.2 Results of short stack testing 
A full scale MEA was manufactured to the design previously tested with the machined 
flow field.  Seals were applied to the bipolar plates and the manifolds and the short 
stack was assembled using the metal strapping configuration shown above. Several 
issues became evident: 

1) First, the ABS 3-D printed H2 manifolds were found to be both permeable to H2 gas 
diffusion and difficult to seal to the edge of the single cell stack.   

Corrective action: To address this issue metallic manifolds were manufactured that 
would not allow diffusion of the H2 and facilitate edge sealing.   

2) After the new H2 manifolds were installed single cell testing commenced using the 
Scribner test system and the single cell Arduino controller.  Operational testing indicated 
performance substantially below expectations.  Further testing indicated the possibility 
of inadequate internal cell compression.  To determine if this was the cause, the single 

66 

 
 
 
 
cell was disassembled, the MEA was removed and pressure sensitive measurement 
paper was placed in the MEA location and the cell was reassembled using the strapping 
method.  After assembly and compression, the measurement paper was removed and 
inspected.  Inspection indicated poor internal compression leading to high interfacial 
contract resistance.  

Corrective Action: An assessment of the load train indicated that the 3D printed 
endplate and the strapping mechanism were not able to provide adequate in-cell 
compression.  A revised load train was designed and fabricated using conventional 
metallic endplates, ties rods and compression Belleville washers.  Versions were 
manufactured suitable for both the single cell and 50 cell stacks. 

While the strapping mechanism is widely used in fuel cell manufacture further review of 
the implementation on this stack indicated more detailed design analysis and 
development was required than available within remaining program resources.  Also, 
since the primary purpose of this stage of testing was verification of fundamental 
operation of the cell and stack, use of a conventional load train minimized development 
variables.    

3) Testing of the single cell resumed using the revised manifolds, endplates and tie rod 
configuration.  Internal compression was as planned and testing at lower power levels 
replicated single cell testing of coupons and in machined plates.  However, testing at 
higher power levels indicated dry out in the MEA.  A humidification device was added to 
provide at least partial humidification of the inlet cathode air.  With this is in place, 
testing resumed and achieved successful operation of the single cell using the formed 
bipolar plates, figure 55. 

Corrective Action-Dry Air Operation: While operation was successful the design is 
based on operation with dry air with self-humidifying MEAs not an external humidifier.  
Further investigation of previous successful coupon testing indicated the Scribner test 
equipment may have had residual moisture present that provided a degree of 
humidification.  After further review Infinity determined that the membrane was suitable 
for dry air operation but the GDLs could be further optimized to retain moisture within 
the cell.  Moisture retentive GDLs used in similar applications were identified, selected 
and purchased however they were not able to be integrated into the test program within 
the available schedule.  This is a planned future IRAD or other effort.      

67 

 
 
 
Figure 57 The Full Area Single Cell Met Initial Performance Goals 

After achieving successful single cell testing the next step was to assemble and test the 
50-cell prototype cell stack.  Prototype stack manufacture is detailed in Section 4.2 and 
testing is detailed in Section 5. 

4.1.6 Controls 

The control of the fuel cell stack and safe operation of hydrogen delivery was 
accomplished via an Arduino control board. Several of the control algorithms to be 
employed in the overall control system architecture have already been developed over 
the course of single cell testing. Arduino was chosen as a developmental control’s 
platform due to ease of use, quick-turn modification potential, and low cost. This 
controller has satisfied all testing to date and is projected to satisfy prototype system 
demonstration as well.  

Once coupon testing was completed at WNEU, full scale testing commenced on 
Infinity’s fuel cell test stand. Having a test capability of 500 W, this stand is capable of 
testing single to multiple full-scale cells, or short stacks, for further prove-out once all 
MEAs and BPPs are fabricated, and prior to assembling the complete fuel cell stack. 
Combinations of several flow field types were tested on both anode and cathode sides 
of Infinity’s MEA to prove out analytical performance modeling. Flow field design is 
critical to the overall performance, as well as mass and volume reduction of the fuel cell 
stack.

Figure 58 Infinity's 500 W Fuel Cell Test Station 

The control system for the single cell testing has been finalized, assembled and tested. 
The single cell system consists of hydrogen supply and hydrogen vent valves, a Nidec 
blower for air supply, a relay module, current sensor, and load contactor. An Arduino-
based CPU will be used to control and monitor all components and signals. Other 
signals to be received and monitored by the Arduino are cell stack voltage, battery 
voltage, and cell stack temperature. A complete system schematic can be seen in 
Figure 59. All of the signals and controls will be visible and accessible via a GUI. 

69 

 
 
 
 
Figure 59 Electrical Schematic for Class II Drone Fuel Cell System 

The valves chosen for the hydrogen supply and vent are simple 12-volt solenoid valves 
with very low power (1 W) consumption. These valves have barbed fittings integrated 
into the body to reduce weight of any additional required fittings and have a sealing 
capacity of 50 psi. 

The blower to be used for single cell testing has been selected for its simplicity, 
durability, and air flow capacity. The blower only requires 24 V power and a 0-5 V signal 
(supplied from the Arduino via the control software) to regulate blower speed. The 
blower is also capable of air flows up to 100 L/min and thus can be used for much larger 
builds if necessary.  

The relay module consists of 4 opto-isolated relays mounted to a single board. Powered 
by 5 V these relays are used to send power to the various devices (solenoid valves, 
contactor, etc.) on the control system. They were selected for their low power 
consumption (< 0.5 W), and their relay solenoid isolation from the rest of the system. 

The power for all the devices in the single cell control system will come from 3 different 
power supplies: 5 V, 12 V, and 24 V power is required. On the full stack system, these 
will all be replaced by low power DC/DC convertors and will draw power directly from 
the battery or the fuel cell. 

70 

 
 
 
 
 
The GUI has also been updated, see Figure 60. Included now are warning lights to 
indicate to the operator that certain parameters have exceeded a predetermined 
warning and/or alarm limit. The system can record data, including fuel cell voltage, 
battery voltage, current, fuel cell temperature, and hydrogen supply pressure. A live plot 
of fuel cell and battery voltages provides real-time insight into power system health. 

Figure 60 Updated Graphical User Interface (GUI) 

For ease of operation, an automated start and shutdown have been pre-programmed 
into the control logic. Pressing the start button will initiate the blower to supply air to the 
fuel cell, open the hydrogen supply valve, and vent the stack to remove any air on the 
anode. Fuel cell stack health will be monitored via voltage sense and, when the stack is 
ready to accept a load, indicate to the user that the system is ready for operation. The 
automated shutdown operation initiates removal of power from the blower and hydrogen 
valves, while also switching back to battery potential via the contactor in the system. 

The air blower speed will be controlled manually for single cell testing. Appropriate 
blower speed versus stoichiometric air reactant requirement will be determined during 
single cell testing. The data obtained will be used to develop tabular air flow versus 
PWM signal information which will then be incorporated into the full-scale control logic. 

A duplicate control system is being built to use for software development and to have as 
a backup to the original control system. All of the required components have been 
ordered and are now in stock. Assembly of the second control system has begun and is 
expected to finish in early January.  

71 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1.7 Hydrogen Storage 

The design and control of the overall fuel cell system within an aircraft – a drone in this 
case – requires management of hydrogen pressure, stack temperature, system voltage 
and current, along with necessary safety measures. The system under development for 
inclusion in Infinity’s Class II drone has been designed to provide proper control and 
safety while minimizing overall size and weight.  

To this end, a single hydrogen tank with attached regulator has been coupled with a 
small blower or fan to provide both hydrogen and air to the fuel cell stack, Figure 61. In 
this arrangement, the energy storage system is decoupled from the power system (the 
fuel cell), yielding opportunity for scalability and flexibility in future UAS and transport 
aircraft applications. The positioning of the system precludes the use of the payload bay 
of this particular aircraft, however, future airframe design with dedicated fuel cell 
integration would open up dedicated volumes for payload use.  

Figure 61 Prototype Fuel Cell System Integration 

The housing around the fuel cell system in the image is the fuselage of the Penguin 
aircraft. This is a pusher prop design, so the electric motor and propeller reside off the 
flat face located to the rear of the fuel cell (shown in blue). The configuration of fuel cell 
stack is outfitted with a separate cooling fan and air blower; the configuration to be built 
may be a single air feed used for both reactant supply and cooling. The control board is 
not mounted within this image. The hydrogen tank is 4,500 psi capable with an internal 
volume of 1.6 liters. This hydrogen volume, along with Infinity’s fuel cell stack, should 
provide an average flight time of approximately 1.2 hours, depending on mission profile 
and flight dynamics. This projected flight time will satisfy benchtop testing and 

72 

 
 
 
 
 
 
preliminary flight testing. The regulator attached to the hydrogen tank has been 
designed specifically for the drone market by a supplier to Infinity and therefore has the 
low mass and volume required for the application  

Hydrogen tanks and regulators have been ordered and will be integrated upon receipt. 
These components have been engineered by a leader in the compressed gas 
equipment market specifically for the size and weight efficiencies required in the drone 
market. 

The hydrogen storage tank is a Type III (metal liner) Carbon Fiber Overwrap Pressure 
Vessel (COPV), Figure 62. This particular tank was chosen due to it lightweight 
materials and pressure capability. The intent of this program is to store the hydrogen at 
lower pressure than the 310 bar (~4,500 psi) rated working pressure. This tank has a 
1.5 L volume, capable of providing enough run time of the fuel cell system to prove out 
its operation for an extended period of time. 

Figure 62 Lightweight Hydrogen Storage Tank 

The hydrogen regulator, Figure 63, will be obtained from the same supplier as the tank. 
This tank/regulator combination was purposely designed and built for drone 
applications, with reduced mass and volume as a packaged component. 

Update:  An order was placed in October 2018 for the above equipment.  After 
assurances that the production was on track but with significant delays the vendor 
informed Infinity in April 2019 they could not deliver.  As a result, Infinity utilized in-
house stored reactants for all hydrogen testing. The vendor claims that product will be 
available in the future.  Infinity is also seeking alternative sources.

4.2 Full Scale Prototype Manufacturing - Components 

Based on the results of component and subsystem development and test as described 
above manufacturing of the final prototype manufacturing commenced.   

4.2.1 Bipolar Plate Manufacturing  

As noted in Section 4.1.2 above one set of bipolar plate hardware had been previously 
procured and several pieces had been nickel plated.   Evaluation of this hardware 
indicated two issues: 

1) The vendor that annealed the plates damaged them in process and had 
contaminated the surfaces 

2) The nickel plating was very heavy and indicated lower than planned conductivity 

For these two reasons Infinity decided to remanufacture the bipolar plates.  A second 
heat treat vendor was selected and a company specializing in stainless steel fuel cell 
bipolar coatings was used for the conductive coating.  This company had not been used 
earlier since they are located in Sweden and we preferred to attempt to develop a local 
source. 

Manufacturing with these new vendors was successful.  The plates were formed, heat 
treated and coated as required. 

Sealing 

As noted in the sealing section above the stack uses a framed MEA and elastomeric 
seals between that frame and the bipolar plates and edge feed manifolds for stack 
reactant feed. In this initial implementation of the design we elected to also use 
elastomeric seals within the two parts of the bipolar plate.  In accordance with 
procedures previously developed elastomeric seals were applied as required onto all of 
the bipolar plate parts and on manifold assemblies as required.      

74 

 
 
 
 
 
4.2.2 Endplates tie rods and follow up materials 

As previously described the endplate design was changed for this prototype to minimize 
variables in regard to in-cell loading and compression.  

4.2.3 MEAs  

MEAs sufficient to support the 50-cell build were manufactured at Infinity.  These MEAs, 
Figure 64, for this build are based on the successful development testing.  They are 
Nafion®-based and fully framed with PET at the outer perimeter. As noted above, the 
assembly of the MEA follows a GDE-based process and requires hot pressing to 
properly set catalytic zones.  

Figure 64 Final Membrane and Electrode Assembly (MEA) 

4.3 Fuel Cell Stack Assembly & System Hardware 

4.3.1 Assembly Process 

After all of the required components were prepared for assembly, the 50-cell prototype 
stack was assembled using the stacking fixture described earlier.  In that process each 
cell was placed in the fixture and three sides were aligned to the fixture.  In the revised 
endplate configuration, figure 63, the tie rods were tightened to compress the 
elastomeric seals to the required dimensions. During the compression process some 
excess seal material was observed as extruded to the edges of the cells and the force 
required to compress was higher than anticipated.    

75 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 65 Fully Compressed Prototype Stack on Test 

After the stack was compressed the manifold plates were mounted on each end pf the 
stack and attached to the endplates by machine screw fasteners.   

4.3.2 Manufacturing Testing  

Prior to operation testing static tests were done to confirm proper overall sealing and 
electrical impedance of the stack and of each cell.  Dry impedances were somewhat 
higher than anticipated but appeared to be acceptable for initial operation.  The excess 
seal material observed during compression appeared to be partially preventing internal 
cell loading distribution from reaching planned design levels.  

The cells appeared to seal properly however, after this initial assembly some excess 
leakage was detected from the H2 manifolds. Additional seal material was applied to the 
manifolds and the rate reduced to acceptable levels for initial performance testing.  
Improvement of this manifold seal was identified as a future item to correct.

5.0 Performance Testing and  Environmental Test Plans  

5.1 Prototype Test setup and Plan  

5.1.1 Setup  

With a goal of 1.5 kW peak power, the prototype test required use of a higher power 
capable load and the prototype compatible Arduino controller.  The following equipment 
was used, Figure 66, as the test setup for prototype testing.

Figure 66 Prototype Test Setup 

77 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
5.1.2 Test Plan  

This was the initial test of the first build of this prototype.  Accordingly, the planned 
testing focused on fundamental operation: 

•  Start/stop operation  
•  Steady-state stability at low loads 
•  Performance characterization across varying current densities  

The test was configured for staffed operation with operator input required to provide 
power to the control system, select airflow rates, and manually adjust various control 
parameters such as vent frequency depending on the observed operation.   When fully 
characterized the control system should eb able to allow the system to run in a fully 
automated manner but our test protocol required staffing for this initial operation and 
characterization. 

5.2 Performance test results 

5.2.1 Test Conditions and Initial Performance: 

The stack was mounted to the test system the week of May 6, 2019 and testing started.   

Initial conditions were:  

•  H2 Pressure: approx. 16 psia 
•  Air Pressure to blower: lab ambient  
•  Stack starting temperature: 25 deg C  

The control system was provided with required power and reactants were applied to the 
stack. The stack polarized as planned and exhibited an average OCV of approximately 
900 mV.  However, as load was applied the cell voltages exhibited a lower than required 
response.  This had been observed previously in single cell testing however once 
humidity was added to the air the single cell would wet up and perform to acceptable 
levels. 

The MEAs are fabricated and stored dry however the fuel cell reaction requires 
hydrated membranes to allow protonic conduction.  The MEAs used in this build are 
designed for dry operation but do need a small amount of initial water production to 
hydrate and allow current to flow.  To facilitate operation a humidifier device was added 
to the inlet air flow circuit and testing resumed.  

5.2.2 Results 

With humidified air the MEAs did improve operation but were still below expectations. 
Open Circuit Voltage, OCV was acceptable and operation up to approximately 100 
watts stable however voltages were lower than modeled.  The prototype stack was 

78 

 
 
 
 
 
allowed to operate for several days with variations in humidification and increases in H2 
supply pressure that did slightly improve performance  

Figure 67 Initial Testing of 50 cell FAA Prototype Cell Stack 

After further operation and humidification failed to increase performance the stack was 
dismounted and impedances were measured again.  Cell average impedance was 
approximately 50 mohm as compared to the single cell that measured approximately 
19.6 mohm after a similar initial break-in run.  The conclusion was that cell impedances 
were higher than planned due to internal electrical conductivity being lower than 
planned due to excessive seal material that did not compress fully on stacking and 
assembly.  No further testing was conducted pending further review however a plan was 
developed to modify the stack to correct excessive seal material issue to improve 
conductivity and overall performance.  This plan is part of the recommended next 
actions discussed below.   

While full power operation was not achieved the overall result was encouraging.  The 
stack started and stopped as planned, operation was stable even if lower than planned, 
operation over the current range measured was linear and indicated a correctable stack 
impedance issue.  The control system worked as planned and provided a basis for next 
generation hardware and software upgrades. 

79 

 
 
 
 
5.3 Aircraft Integration  

The overall program has focused more on development of the prototype stack and 
system and less on integration into the planned airframe however this remains a goal of 
the overall product effort.  To advance this Infinity is exploring continued stack and 
system development and test and additional aircraft integration under internal IRAD 
efforts.   

5.4 Flight Design vs. Test Prototype 

While the planned 3D printed materials had excessive permeation that prevented use in 
the final prototype the overall package remains a highly attractive approach for final 
implementation in suitable materials.  Using the parts originally intended for the 
prototype, Infinity assembled a second stack to explore form and fit within the target 
aircraft.  This mockup stack, figure 67 is comprised of 50 cells using actual anode and 
cathode flow fields and uses the endplates, manifolds and strapping approach from the 
baseline design. As an IRAD activity we plan to use this packaging mockup to explore 
placement on the aircraft and integration within the fuselage, figure 68.

6.0 Conclusions and Recommendations  

6.1 Conclusions 

The goal of the program was to use development of a fuel cell system intended for use 
on a Class II drone to serve the dual purpose of technology development and provide a 
basis for review for compliance with transport aircraft requirements including: CFR Part 
25 regulations, Safety Hazard analyses and DO-160 environmental test requirements. 

Overall conclusion:  

The system development process achieved partial success but more remains to done to 
reach complete system operability.  However, the process did provide the design basis 
for the document development and evaluation regarding Part 25 requirements, Safety 
Hazard analyses and environmental test requirements.  The stack and system have yet 
to achieved their overall design performance goals but did achieve partial success with 
next steps identified that are planned to be implemented under Infinity internal funding 
as resources permit.   

The overall effort attempted to achieve a system embodying product, price and 
performance characteristics suitable for low cost implementation across multiple 
markets and vehicles. Achieving this low cost/high performance objective, especially 
within the scope of the effort, proved challenging.  Lower cost design approaches 
impacted performance. Addressing resulting performance issues required modification 
of some of the lower cost design approaches and impacted overall cost and schedule.      

However, the combined effect of this iterative process resulted in achievement of 
several lower cost stack and high-performance system elements, especially in the area 
of MEA manufacturing and flow-field design, that will carry forward into continuing 
development.  It also highlighted other design approaches, such as edge feed plates, 
that are of questionable benefit and still others such as banded-stack retention that 
appear to be excellent cost-performance options but required additional engineering to 
mature.       

The systems effort also provided valuable insight into aircraft integration and 
certification.  The UAV Factory, the manufacturer of the Infinity owned-Penguin BE 
aircraft, makes this platform available to system integrators and even provides 4-day 
training sessions specifically to assist integrators in customizing the platform for their 
applications.  As the fuel cell system advances in the  next stage we intend to 
participate in such training working toward a system that can be retrofit to the Penguin 
BE as a package for operators that want to investigate a fuel cell system as a range 
extender for all- electric operations.

Table 15 below provides a detailed summary of the results and recommended next 
steps. The program achieved significant progress in several key design elements and 
identified areas where additional development is required.

and join the two-part bipolar plate on 
assemble   

- Manifold design  

- Objective: Simplify manifold 
implementation and provide flexible 
modular stack 

- Approach: Implement as edge-seal 
design with manifolds formed by 3-D 
printed structures applied to target 
bipolar plate edge sections  

- Result: Joining the bipolar 
parts during the final stack 
assembly proved difficult and 
created sealing and interfacial 
contact issues that can be 
readily addressed by joining 
prior to assembly with a 
permanent bond/weld process  

1) Join bipolar plates prior to 
stack assembly  

2) Investigate cost/weight 
tradeoffs of one double sided 
etched part for open 
cathode-air cooled 
implementation  

Did not perform as planned 

Corrective action: 

1) Initial 3-D parts were porous 
and leaked 

2) Initial implementation of 
elastomeric seals on bipolar 
plates intruded onto manifold 

There are many challenges 
since you are trying to seal 
on an inherently imperfect 
surface.  This may be 
possible with high precision 
parts but the combination of 
limited production-formed

parts exacerbated an 
already challenging seal 
approach. 

1) Retain initial bipolar 
plates-conventional manifold 
design  

Results: Very Good 

Next Steps: 

New framed MEA was 
designed, and manufactured in-
house and met design 
performance requirements 
except for dry air operation in an 
open cathode configuration  

Redesigned GDLs have 
been identified and procured 
that should allow operation 
on dry air in an open 
cathode configuration  

Result: Incomplete 

Corrective Action: 

3D printed manifolds were 
permeable and could not seal 
H2.  These were replaced with 
aluminum manifolds that sealed 
H2 but edge seal in general was 
a challenge.  It eventually was 
sealed but the design is not 
robust 

Result: In Process 

First try at 3D printed strapped 
endplates did not work.  Load 
train was inadequate and no 
means of ensuring internal load 
train provided. 

Conventional revised endplate 
was implemented that sealed 
and could provide good 
interfacial contact resistance 

Modify bipolar plate design 
to return to allow 
implementation of a 
conventional manifold design 

Corrective Action: The 
shaped endplate-strapped 
design theoretically provides 
an excellent low-cost 
approach to stack assembly 
and has been implemented 
by others in the fuel cell 
industry. 

This implementation via 3D 
printed parts was 
inadequate.  Design 
changes have been 
identified and will be 
implemented in future builds    

Result: Partial Success  

Corrective Actions:  

The stack was assembled and 
tested but assembly was 
difficult. Excess elastomeric seal 
material unloaded active area 
increasing contact resistance 
and flowed external to bipolar 
plates making edge sealing 
difficult but eventually did seal. 

Internal impedances were high 
and explained limited 
performance.  However, 
impedances were uniform. 

Longer term- Implement 
changes for stack 
components detailed above. 

Near Term: Disassemble, 
clean parts.  Seal bipolar 
plates prior to assemble and 
reapply elastomeric seals to 
ensure no seal material 
flows external to plates when 
compressed. 

Ability to record individual cell 
voltages during test was limited   

Reduce number of cells on 
test from 50 to 40/45to allow 
current test load equipment 
to monitor and record all

1.0 Summary 
Purpose: 

The purpose of this document is to serve both as a guide to meeting requirements for integration of 
a Fuel Cell into a Class II UAS and as a reference for subsequent integration of a similar Fuel Cell 
into a Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14 Part 25 (known as 14 CFR Part 25) regulated Transport 
Aircraft. 

Tasks required under the Infinity-FAA Contract DTFACT-16-C-00038 include the design and 
analysis of the integration of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell, PEMFC, into a Class II 
UAS, with the initial target aircraft being an Infinity-owned Fuel Cell Factory Penguin BE, Figure 
1.  While the initial focus is on the UAS integration, part of this effort is to assess the suitability, 
including compatibility, performance, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), effectiveness, etc. of the 
design of the UAS fuel cell product to meet requirements of CFR Part 25 if installed for use 
aboard a passenger transport aircraft.   

In 2015 the FAA chartered an Energy Supply Device Aircraft Rulemaking Committee, ESD ARC, 
with objectives to: 

a. Develop a plan for determining appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance for 

energy supply device installations. with a primal)' focus on transport airplanes but also 
considering other types of aircraft. 

b. Identify hazards associated with installations of hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, ultra-

capacitors, and other energy supply devices on transport airplanes and other types of 
aircraft. 

c. Identify the designs and operational principles that may be used to safeguard against 

these hazards. 

d. Identify the current rules in Title 14, Code of Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR) 

part 25 that are applicable for addressing energy supply device installations. 
e. Determine proposed revisions of, and any additions to, the applicable part 25 rules 

needed to provide an appropriate and adequate level of safety for energy supply device 
installations and operation. 

f. Review the existing advisory circulars and FAA policy memorandums and statements 
that provide guidance relating to this subject and determine proposed revisions or 
additions to the guidance. As a part of this effort, determine proposed guidance on the 
assumptions and approach that should be used to perform a safety assessment of these 
energy supply device installations. 

g. Recommend appropriate airworthiness standards and guidance for energy supply device 

installations. 

One of the outputs of the ARC process was a detailed summary, by subpart, mapping the likely 
applicability  of  existing  Part  25  regulations  to  various  fuel  cell  related  applications  as  well 
identifying proposed new regulations.

Building from this the ARC analysis, this current document maps ARC identified regulations to the 
UAS fuel cell, identifies compliance approaches and reviews additional effort that may be required 
for a Transport Aircraft to use that UAS fuel cell aboard a Part 25 regulated aircraft.   

This assumes that integration into a currently certified Transport Aircraft would require approval of 
a  Supplemental  Type  Certificate.    To  support  that,  another  goal  of  this  document  is  to  assist  in 
planning  for  a  STC  application,  Figure  2,  and  in  planning  for  development  of  familiarization 
materials to be used in developing a proposed Certification Basis.  

While this document uses the UAS integration as the baseline project this document is also intended 
to serve as a reference document compiling relevant portions of the ARC, Part 25 and Air Circulars 
cited by the ARC related to fuel cells.

Figure 2 STC Application Process 

The goal of this process is to design the system, whenever possible, in such a way so as to both 
satisfy  UAS  requirements  and  Part  25.      In  instances  where  the  design  does  not  align  with  the 
requirements of Part 25, a goal is to define how future designs may be met. In instances where the 
demands of the section are believed to be inapplicable to either the current or future design such 
designation is made in the relevant portion of the design study.

Fuel cell stack Technology description  
The cell stack, Figure 3 is a 50 cell, stack of 90 cm2 H2-air cells operating at a nominal 65 deg C.  
The baseline design that will be tested first is an open cathode configuration where a common air 
source is used for both oxygen supply and cooling.  The stack cell architecture is designed to 
allow reconfiguration to a close cathode if required.

Figure 5 System Control Block Diagram 

Packaging  
The system under development for inclusion in Infinity’s Class II drone has been designed to provide proper 
control and safety while minimizing overall size and weight. To this end, a single hydrogen tank with attached 
regulator has been coupled with a small blower or fan to provide both hydrogen and air to the fuel cell stack, 
Figure 6. In this arrangement, the energy storage system, the hydrogen, is decoupled from the power system 
(the  fuel  cell),  yielding  opportunity  for  scalability  and  flexibility  in  future  UAS  and  transport  aircraft 
applications. The positioning of the system precludes the use of the payload bay of this particular aircraft, 
however, future airframe design with dedicated fuel cell integration would open up dedicated volumes for 
payload use.

Figure 1 Prototype Fuel Cell System Integration 

The housing around the fuel cell system in the image is the fuselage of the Penguin aircraft. This is a pusher 
prop design, so the electric motor and propeller reside off  the flat face located to the rear of the fuel cell 
(shown in blue). The configuration of fuel cell stack is outfitted with a separate cooling fan and air blower; 
the configuration to be built may be a single air feed used for both reactant supply and cooling. The control 
board is not mounted within this image. The hydrogen tank is 4,500 psi capable with an internal water volume 
of  1.6  liters  capable  of  storing  approximately  35  to  40  grams  of  hydrogen.  This  hydrogen,  along  with 
Infinity’s fuel cell stack, should provide an average flight time of approximately 1.2 hours, depending on 
mission profile and flight dynamics. This projected flight time will satisfy benchtop testing and preliminary 
flight testing. The regulator attached to the hydrogen tank has been designed specifically for the drone market 
by a supplier to Infinity and therefore has the low mass and volume required for the application

The Fuel Cell System comprises all fuel cell components and specifications necessary to 
provide compliance with the Product Performance Specification.   

This document focuses on requirements that will be verified by environmental and other testing.  
A complete quality assurance compliance will include all quality requirements including those 
identified here.  This document also compares initial currently defined test requirements for the 
Drone fuel cell power and energy system to “RTCA/DO-160E Environmental Conditions and 
Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment”. 

The following table documents the expected verification evidence needed to confirm the product 
meets the environmental and related performance requirements for the drone powerplant 
application. The 'ID' is the alphanumeric code used to uniquely identify each requirement.

 DO-160 and Internal Test Selection Approach 

The approach for selection of tests is as follows: 

1) Define initial intended application as propulsion power for unmanned 50lb TOW drone fixed 
wing aircraft  

2) Define Objective level quality and performance requirements including environmental factors.  
Incorporating various customer defined requirements including: 

• 

• 

• 

MIL-STD-810G - Department of Defense Test Method Standard Environmental 
Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests 
RTCA/DO-160E Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne 
Equipment 
MIL-STD-461F - Department of Defense Interface Standard Requirements for the 
Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and 
Equipment 

3) Define initial quality characteristic verification method for each requirement;    

• 
Inspection (I),  
•  Demonstration (D),  
•  Analysis (A) or  
•  Test (T).  

4) Summarize test/demonstration verification items in one table  

5) Review DO-160 and relevant MIL specifications to determine areas of overlap and similarity  

6) Develop a preliminary DO-160 compliance matrix for drone aircraft application.

Discussion: 

The intended application is as the prime power system for an unmanned 50lb maximum TOW 
drone capable of flight to an altitude of 20,000ft. As such the equipment is located in an 
unpressurized, ventilated location and the aircraft it is housed in is exposed to ambient 
conditions.   

This drone power  system  application is the reference application being used to evaluate the 
categories of tests required both as internal requirements to meet anticipated military needs and 
as a starting point revaluation relative to manned applications. 

While the unmanned drone application may not require  the defined tests for certification, the 
design requirements are demanding.  Operation is in an unpressurized enclosure, subject to an 
uncontrolled external environment.  The system is required to survive often severe shock and 
vibration and maintain EMI/RFI compatibility and be stored and operate over wide temperature 
ranges.

temperature test, and Paragraph 4.5.2, the operating low temperature test. After 
completion of the test defined in Paragraph 4.5.1 and 4.5.2, proceed to Subparagraph c. 
If the test is not a combined test, commencing at ambient temperature with the 
equipment operating, lower the temperature in the chamber towards the operating low 
temperature level at the applicable rates specified in Subsection 5.2. 
b. Stabilize the equipment in the operating mode at this operating low temperature level. 
c. Raise the temperature in the chamber towards the operating high temperature at the 
applicable rate specified in Subsection 5.2. During this temperature change, 
DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE EQUIPMENT 
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. 
d. Stabilize the equipment at the operating high temperature. If this is a combined test, 
proceed in accordance with Paragraph 4.5.3, the ground survival high temperature test 
and short-time operating high temperature test, and subsequently Paragraph 4.5.4, the 
operating high temperature test. Maintain the equipment in a non-operating state for a 
minimum of 2 minutes. 
e. Turn the equipment on and lower the temperature in the chamber towards the operating 
low temperature level at the applicable rate specified in Subsection 5.2. During this 
temperature change DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE 
EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. 
f. Stabilize the equipment temperature with the chamber at the operating low 
temperature, and then operate the equipment for at least one hour. Then turn off the 
equipment for 30 minutes, and restart the equipment while maintaining the chamber at 
the operating low temperature. 
g. Change the temperature of the chamber towards the ambient temperature at the 
applicable rate specified in Subsection 5.2. 
h. Stabilize the chamber and the equipment at ambient temperature. DETERMINE 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE 
STANDARDS. 
A minimum of two cycles (a. through h. above) shall be accomplished. If complete determination of 
compliance with applicable equipment performance standards can be accomplished during each 
temperature change period of a single cycle, then testing is required during the second cycle only. If the 
time during a temperature change period does not allow for complete determination of compliance with 
5-3 
© 2004 RTCA, Inc 
applicable equipment performance standards, a sufficient number of cycles shall be accomplished so that 
complete compliance can be determined. When temperature rise induces a potential risk of condensation 
on the equipment under test, the humidity level of the air in the chamber should be controlled to eliminate 
this condensation. The test profile is shown graphically in Figure 5-1. 
Note: If this is a combined test, it is not necessary to repeat the Ground Survival Low 
Temperature, Short-Time Operating Low Temperature, Ground Survival High

Section 6.0  
Humidity Category C - External Humidity Environment 
Equipment may be required to be operated under conditions such that it is subjected to 
direct contact with outside air for periods of time in excess of that specified for the 
standard humidity environment. 

Category C—External Humidity Environment 
The test profile is shown graphically in Figure 6-3. The procedure shall be in accordance 
with the following steps: 
Step 1: Install the test item in the test chamber, and ensure its configuration is 
representative of that used in actual service. 

Step 2: Stabilize the test item at 30 ±2 oC and 85 ±4 % RH. 

Step 3: Over a two-hour period, ±10 minutes, raise the chamber temperature to 55 ±2 oC 
and increase the RH to 95 ±4 %. 
6-4 

Step 4: Maintain the chamber temperature at 55 oC with the RH at 95 ±4 % for six hours 
minimum. 

Step 5: During the next 16-hour period, ±15 minutes, decrease the temperature 
gradually to 38 oC or lower. During this period, keep the RH as high as possible 
and do not allow it to fall below 85 %. 

Step 6: Steps 3, 4 and 5 constitute a cycle. Repeat these steps until a total of six cycles 
(144 hours of exposure) have been completed. 

Step 7: At the end of the exposure period, remove the equipment from the test chamber 
and drain off (do not wipe) any condensed moisture. Within one hour after the 
six cycles are completed, apply normal supply power and turn on the equipment. 
Allow 15 minutes maximum following the application of primary power for the 
equipment to warm up. For equipment that does not require electrical power for 
operation, warm up the equipment for 15 minutes maximum by the application 
of heat not to exceed the short-time operating high temperature test as required 
by applicable equipment categories. Immediately following the warm-up period, 
make such tests and measurements as are necessary to DETERMINE 
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE 
STANDARDS.

7.0  Operational Shocks and Crash Safety 
7.1 Purpose of the Tests 
The operational shock test verifies that the equipment will continue to function 
within performance standards after exposure to shocks experienced during 
normal aircraft operations. These shocks may occur during taxiing, landing or 
when the aircraft encounters sudden gusts in flight. This test applies to all 
equipment installed on fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Two operational 
shock test curves are provided; a standard 11 msec pulse and a low frequency 20 
msec pulse. The 20 ms pulse may not be adequate to test against the effect of 
longest duration shocks on equipment that have its lowest resonance frequency 
(as per section 8) below 100Hz. 
The crash safety test verifies that certain equipment will not detach from its 
mountings or separate in a manner that presents a hazard during an emergency 
landing. It applies to equipment installed in compartments and other areas of the 
aircraft where equipment detached during emergency landing could present a

hazard to occupants, fuel systems or emergency evacuation equipment. These 
tests do not satisfy FAR requirements for all equipment, e.g. seats and seat 
restraints. 
Note: For fixed-wing aircraft: a complete installation demonstration, i.e. 
including aircraft acceleration loads (such as flight manoeuvring, gust 
and landing) in addition to the crash safety loads, may be accomplished 
by using the "Unknown or Random" orientations for the "sustained" test 
procedure. 
Using a dummy load on the shock test apparatus may be necessary to ensure that 
the recorded shock pulse will be within the specified tolerances of Figure 7-2.

location not intentionally protected against sand and dust exposure. 

Recommended Category D 

13.0 Fungus Resistance:  Note: Most materials do not appear susceptible – verify  by analysis 

13.1 Purpose of the Test 
These tests determine whether equipment material is adversely affected by fungi under 
conditions favorable for their development, namely, high humidity, warm atmosphere 
and presence of inorganic salts. 
Notes: 
A. Fungi proximity to other materials, exposure to daily susceptible 
contaminants such as fluids during routine operation and maintenance, or 
equipment exposure to solar actinic effects - may break molecular bonds and 
reduce the item to sub-compositions which may be fungus nutrients. 
B. This test shall not be conducted after Salt Spray or Sand and Dust. A heavy 
concentration of salt may effect the fungal growth, and sand and dust can 
provide nutrients, which could compromise the validity of this test (see 
Subsection 3.2, “Order of Tests”). 
13.2 General Effects 
Typical problems caused by fungi growing on equipment are: 
a. Microorganisms digest organic materials as a normal metabolic process, thus 
degrading the substrate, reducing the surface tension and increasing moisture 
penetration. 
b. Enzymes and organic acids, produced during metabolism, diffuse out of the cells 
and onto the substrate and cause metal corrosion, glass etching, hardening of 
grease and other physical and chemical changes to the substrates. 
c. The physical presence of microorganisms produces living bridges across 
components that may result in electrical failures. 
d. The physical presence of fungi can also cause health problems and produce 
aesthetically unpleasant situations in which users will reject using the equipment. 
The detrimental effects of fungal growth are summarized as follows: 
a. Direct attack on materials. Nonresistant materials are susceptible to direct attack 
as fungus breaks these materials down and uses them as nutrients. This results in 
deterioration affecting the physical properties of the material. Examples of nonresistant 
materials are:

(1) Natural material. Products of natural origin (carbon based) are most 
susceptible to this attack. 
(a) Cellulose materials (e.g., wood, paper, natural fiber textiles, and cordage). 
(b) Animal- and vegetable-based adhesives. 
13-2 
 (c) Grease, oils, and many hydrocarbons. 
(d) Leather. 
(2) Synthetic materials. 
(a) PVC formulations (e.g., those plasticized with fatty acid esters). 
(b) Certain polyurethanes (e.g., polyesters and some polyether). 
(c) Plastics that contain organic fillers of laminating materials. 
(d) Paints and varnishes that contain susceptible constituents. 
b. Indirect attack on materials. Damage to fungus-resistant materials results from 
indirect attack when: 
(1) Fungal growth on surface deposits of dust, grease, perspiration, and other 
contaminants (that find their way onto materiel during manufacture or 
accumulate during service) causes damage to the underlying material, even 
though that material may be resistant to direct attack. 
(2) Metabolic waste products (i.e., organic acids) excreted by fungus cause 
corrosion of metals, etching of glass, or staining or degrading of plastics and 
other materials. 
(3) The acidic waste products of fungus on adjacent materials that are susceptible 
to direct attack come in contact with the resistant materials. 

14.0 Salt Fog: Note: Drone installation provides filtration  

14.1 Purpose of the Test 
This test determines the effects on the equipment of prolonged exposure to a salt 
atmosphere or to salt fog experienced in normal operations. 
The main adverse effects to be anticipated are: 
a. Corrosion of metals. 
b. Clogging or binding of moving parts as a result of salt deposits. 
c. Insulation fault. 
d. Damage to contacts and uncoated wiring. 
Note: The salt fog test shall not be conducted prior to the fungus resistance test (see 
Subsection 3.2, “Order of Tests”). 

14.2 Categories of Equipment

having a horizontal intensity of 14.4 A/m ±10% when the equipment under test is positioned 
on the east-west line through the pivot of a magnet. 
Note 1: If the horizontal component of the magnetic field produced by the earth at the 
location of the test lab is within the tolerance stated above, the angular 
deflection used to determine equipment category in paragraph 15.3 shall be 
one degree (Dc = 1). 
Note: 2: If the horizontal component of the magnetic field produced by the earth at the 
location of the test lab exceeds the tolerance stated above, the angular 
deflection used to determine the equipment category in Subsection 15.3 shall 
be adjusted using the following formula:

18.0 Audio Frequency Conducted Susceptibility - Power Inputs (Closed Circuit Test) 
18.1 Purpose of the Test 
This test determines whether the equipment will accept frequency components of a 
magnitude normally expected when the equipment is installed in the aircraft. These 
frequency components are normally harmonically related to the power source 
fundamental frequency. 
18.2 Equipment Categories and Frequency Classes 
18.2.1 Equipment Categories 
Section 18 utilizes the same designators (CF, NF, and WF) as Section 16: The 
designator (CF) refers to electrical systems where the primary power is from a constant 
frequency (400 Hz) ac system, the designator (NF) refers to electrical systems where the 
primary power is from a narrow variable frequency (360 to 650 Hz) ac system, and the 
designator (WF) refers to electrical systems where the primary power is from a wide 
variable frequency (360 to 800 Hz) ac system. 
Category reference: 
- For ac equipment: R(CF), R(NF), R(WF), K(CF), K(NF) or K(WF) 
- For dc equipment: R, B, or Z 
Categories R(CF), R(NF), R(WF) and R 
Equipment intended for use on aircraft electrical systems where the primary power is 
from a constant or variable frequency ac system and where the dc system is supplied 
from transformer-rectifier units, is identified as: 
• for ac equipment: Category R(CF), R(NF) or R(WF), 
• for dc equipment: Category R. 

Category B 
Dc equipment intended for use on aircraft electrical systems supplied by engine-driven 
alternator/rectifiers, or dc generators where a battery of significant capacity is floating on 
the dc bus at all times, is identified as Category B. Unless otherwise specified, tests 
levels for 14 Vdc equipment are half those shown for 28 Vdc equipment. 
Category K(CF), K(NF) or K(WF) 
Equipment intended for use on aircraft electrical systems where the primary power is 
from a constant or variable frequency ac system and characterized by a voltage distortion 
level higher than the one for the ac supplies applied on category R equipment. 
Category K shall be acceptable for use in place of Category R for ac equipment. 
18-2 
Category Z 
Dc equipment that may be used on all other types of aircraft electrical systems applicable 
to these standards is identified as Category Z. Category Z shall be acceptable for use in 
place of Category R or B. Examples of this category are dc systems supplied from 
variable-speed generators where: 
a. The dc power supply does not have a battery floating on the dc bus, or 
b. Control or protective equipment may disconnect the battery from the dc bus, or. 
c. The battery capacity is small compared with the capacity of the dc generators.

5.7.1 CS101 applicability. 
This requirement is applicable to equipment and subsystem AC, limited to current draws ≤ 100 
amperes per phase, and DC input power leads, not including returns. If the EUT is DC operated, 
this requirement is applicable over the frequency range of 30 Hz to 150 kHz. If the EUT is AC 
operated, this requirement is applicable starting from the second harmonic of the EUT power 
frequency and extending to 150 kHz. 

5.11 CS106, conducted susceptibility, transients, power leads. 
5.11.1 CS106 Applicability. 
This requirement is applicable to submarine and surface ship equipment and subsystem AC and 
DC input power leads, not including grounds and neutrals. 
5.11.2 CS106 limit. 
The EUT shall not exhibit any malfunction, degradation of performance, or deviation from 
specified indications, beyond the tolerances indicated in the individual equipment or subsystem 
specification, when subjected to a test signal with voltage levels as specified in Figure CS106-1.
