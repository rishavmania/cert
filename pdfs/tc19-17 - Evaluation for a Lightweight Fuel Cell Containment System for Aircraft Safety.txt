EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The FAA project “Evaluation of a Lightweight Fuel Cell Containment System for Aircraft Safety” 
evaluated the potential impacts for a future solid oxide fuel cell- (SOFC) based power system to 
be integrated into a small aircraft, as described in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations part 23. A 
target SOFC system using a liquid desulfurized fuel, onboard reformation, and a hybrid battery 
was assessed for  impacts  to existing aircraft safety  regulations. Integration effects of  the  target 
system were studied in the context of failure modes, similarity to existing systems, and potential 
approaches for safe integration into the aircraft. Analyses of worst-case failure modes introduced 
by the SOFC technology were performed to bound the expectations of the failure effects and to 
help characterize the timing for failure identification. An SOFC stack test unit was built to support 
controlled failure testing to verify the analyses. Controlled failure testing was performed on two 
development stacks of different designs, made by different suppliers. Data from the stack tests and 
teardowns indicated that a worst-case sudden failure inside an SOFC stack can be identified with 
existing sensor technology. Also, testing showed that damage from an internal SOFC stack failure 
can be limited by shutting off the fuel flow to the stack to stop the propagation of the failure from 
the stack to surrounding components or systems.  

Significant SOFC development, system optimization, and testing is necessary to support a future 
SOFC-based power system integration into the aircraft. Early assessment of the challenges of new 
technology to aircraft safety helps to identify potential issues prior to integration on an aircraft. 
The analyses, modeling, trades, and testing performed under this project suggest that safe aircraft 
integration  of  a  future  matured  SOFC  power  system  is  feasible  within  the  use  of  existing 
technology.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES 

The use of electric power for aircraft propulsion is a topic of increasing interest in the aviation 
community,  largely  due  to  the  significant  increase  in  efficiency  over  traditional  internal 
combustion engines (ICEs). These devices are also quieter and more environmentally friendly than 
the reciprocating combustion engines that are currently used for primary propulsion for small or 
light aircraft.  

In  recent  years,  technology  investments  in  solid  oxide  fuel  cell  (SOFC)  stack  design  and 
fabrication approaches have reduced the weight of the stacks such that fuel cells offer a higher 
energy density alternative to the much heavier battery technology options. The Boeing Company 
leveraged its SOFC experience to support the NASA-led Fostering Ultra-Efficient Low Emitting 
Aviation Power (FUELEAP) program, which is aimed at a flight demonstration of an advanced 
fuel  cell  power  plant  that  operates  on  infrastructure-friendly  hydrocarbon  fuel.  SOFC  powered 
aircraft have the potential to dramatically reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and noise over a 
comparable  internal  combustion  engine.  Depending  on  the  selected  technology  of  the  various 
system components, an SOFC electrical power system can achieve efficiencies in excess of 60% 
on hydrocarbon fuels, approaching double that of an ICE [1] 

History has shown that the introduction of new technology into an aircraft may also introduce new 
failure modes that can impact flight safety. Early assessment and testing to assist in understanding 
the intricacies of each new technology can help the safe integration of new technology into a flight 
vehicle.  Boeing,  under  the  FAA  project  “Evaluation  of  a  Lightweight  Fuel  Cell  Containment 
System for Aircraft Safety,” has performed an analysis to identify worst-case failures in a future 
SOFC-based power system and has investigated methods of first mitigation and then control and 
containment of such possible failures. Boeing has also identified areas in existing FAA regulations 
that would be applicable to an SOFC-based power system, as well as recommendations for the 
regulations  to  help  incorporate  an  SOFC  power  system  into  the  existing  safety  requirements. 
Finally, Boeing has performed controlled failure testing to mimic the worst-case failure scenario 
to provide data on identifying and stopping propagation of the failures. 

The FAA project “Evaluation of a Lightweight Fuel Cell Containment System for Aircraft Safety” 
is intended as a first step to provide analysis and hard data toward the technical understanding of 
SOFC-based technology for flight to help with future aircraft integration. 

2.  BASELINE AIRCRAFT DESCRIPTION 

2.1  FUELEAP TARGET VEHICLE OVERVIEW 

Boeing supported NASA’s Langley Research Center on the FUELEAP program. The purpose of 
this program was to continue the development of an SOFC stack operating on heavy hydrocarbon 
fuel as the primary power source for a commuter class airplane. The potential application for the 
FUELEAP  SOFC  power  system  is  the  NASA  X-57  Maxwell  flight  demonstrator,  based  on  a 
Tecnam P2006T shown in figure 1. Mod 2 of the X-57 is an all-electric version of the Tecnam, 
which will maintain the outer mold line of the vehicle, but will include battery packs to supply the 
necessary  power  instead  of  a  traditional  combustion  engine.  A  hybrid  SOFC  power  system  is 

1 

 
envisioned to replace the battery packs as the primary power source for a spiral demonstrator flight 
as a step toward a commercial aircraft SOFC power system. 

Figure 1. Tecnam P2006T aircraft 

For the FAA program “Evaluation of a Lightweight Fuel Cell Containment System for Aircraft 
Safety,”  Boeing  used  the  Tecnam  P2006T  aircraft  as  a  baseline  reference  for  an  SOFC-based 
power system to assess and analyze containment and mitigation approaches. The system has to 
mature  significantly  and  demonstrate  multiple  performance  and  safety  targets  before  it  can  be 
considered  for  a  commercial  application.  For  this  reason,  where  possible,  requirements  and 
analyses focused more  on the  general aspects of the system that  would be  relevant to both the 
FUELEAP demonstrator and a future commercial aircraft system. 

A hybridized SOFC-based power system based on near term technology will require more space 
for aircraft integration than traditional ICE-based power systems. An SOFC-based power system 
would not fit in the existing engine volume located in the wings; therefore, the integration volume 
focus  for  the  hybridized  SOFC  power  system  was  in  the  aircraft  cabin,  behind  the  pilot  and 
passenger.  The  envelope  available  for  the  demonstrator  aircraft  SOFC-based  power  system  is 
depicted in figure 2. The volume shown is used to incorporate the entire hybridized power system 
with the exception of the fuel tank, which is currently located in the wing of the existing vehicle.

Figure 2. Envelope for SOFC-based power system 

The  layout  identified  under  the  FUELEAP  program  was  used  as  a  basis  for  the  integration 
assessment  for  this  FAA  program.  The  SOFC-based  power  system  was  configured  [2]  in  the 
envelope to keep the highest temperature components away from the pilot or passengers of the 
aircraft. The SOFC-based power plant, battery system, insulation, firewall, and ventilation were 
targeted for this area. The layout overview internal to the aircraft is shown in figure 3.

2.2  FUELEAP SOFC-BASED POWER SYSTEM OVERVIEW 

A hybrid power system [3] comprised of an SOFC operating as the primary electrical power source 
and  a  rechargeable  battery  for  supplemental  power  is  envisioned  for  both  the  FUELEAP 
demonstrator and future commercial aircraft systems. For the FUELEAP demonstrator system, the 
SOFC will be sized to provide the cruise propulsion power and power to recharge the battery. The 
battery will provide the additional power required for take-off and climb, coasting power in the 
event of a fuel cell system emergency shutdown, and power for sudden power demands. Figure 4 
shows the proposed system configuration. 

Figure 4. FUELEAP hybrid power system architecture 

Both the SOFC and the high voltage batteries are tied to a high voltage bus, which powers the 
inverter that drives  the  electrical  propulsion  motor. The SOFC’s  output is  regulated to provide 
appropriate voltage to the inverter. The SOFC system uses turbomachinery, which incorporates a 
motor  and  generator.  A  starter/regulator  unit  powers  the  motor  during  startup  conditions  and 
regulates the power from the generator during normal operation, therefore providing extra power 
to the high voltage bus. The aircraft’s low voltage bus is retained to power the aircraft’s heritage 
loads and instruments. The low voltage bus is powered from the high voltage bus via a regulator 
and has a battery backup. 

The process flow and layout for the SOFC-based power system is shown in figure 5. Use of a low 
sulfur fuel or desulfurized fuel is needed to meet weight and performance targets for a flight SOFC 
system. This can be accomplished on the ground, using a ground cart desulfurization system to 
remove  sulfur  prior  to  loading  the  vehicle;  however,  this  approach  would  require  additional 
infrastructure at the airport. Steam reformation has been selected for the demonstrator application 

4 

 
 
because  of  the  potential  for  increased  overall  system  efficiency  compared  to  an  auto-thermal 
reformation- (ATR) based system. Steam reformation adds complexity to the system and requires 
further technology development for flight use. Fuel reformation for an SOFC provides hydrogen 
and carbon monoxide along with some unusable, but benign, byproducts to the SOFC stacks. As 
the  stacks  generate  power,  the  effluent,  which  includes  unused  fuel  and  air,  water  vapor,  and 
carbon dioxide, is either recirculated back to the fuel cell to be used by the reformer or directed to 
the combustion chamber. The catalytic combustion chamber, which reaches ~950°C, provides heat 
for steam reformation,  with the  remainder used by a turbine  to  generate additional  power. The 
SOFC power system targeted for light aircraft application does not require liquid cooling, which 
would normally support an internal combustion engine. Depending on the system design, either 
waste heat can be exhausted directly overboard or a ram air heat exchanger can be incorporated to 
reject additional heat to ambient [1].

3.1  REQUIREMENTS ASSESSMENT FOR SOFC-BASED POWER SYSTEM 

Under the FAA project “Evaluation of a Lightweight Fuel Cell Containment System for Aircraft 
Safety,” Boeing reviewed existing light aircraft Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 
23 regulations [4] to ascertain commonality of existing aircraft requirements to an SOFC power 
system. Table 1 shows a generalized overview of similarities/differences between existing aircraft 
power system functions and future SOFC systems. Two main differences are the cooling of the 
unit and the location. Light aircraft engines are usually cooled by both incoming air and liquid 
cooling systems (oil and glycol-type coolant), whereas the targeted SOFC system is designed to 
only be cooled by  incoming  air. The SOFC system is expected to  have a  larger  volume than a 
standard engine and will be a single-power unit in the fuselage instead of in a wing nacelle or in 
the nose of a light commuter aircraft.

Although an SOFC/battery hybrid system providing power to light aircraft would be unique, many 
safety hazards for an SOFC system would be similar to those found for existing propulsion systems 
operating at high temperatures with similar liquid fuels. Table 2 breaks down the main components 
of the SOFC hybrid power system in comparison to components with existing flight history. Many 
components  for  the  SOFC  hybrid  power  system  are  similar  to  flown  components,  with  design 
requirements  already  covered  by  traditional  aircraft  engines  and  auxiliary  power  systems.  For 
example, there is a significant amount of historical data behind flight systems using turbines and 
compressors. The components analyzed for the FUELEAP power system used data from existing 
hardware  that  could  be  used  for  flight.  Depending  on  changes  to  the  future  power  system 
configuration, a turbine or compressor might need to be resized from existing available hardware; 
therefore, the turbine and compressor are listed in both the “SOFC System Components with Flight 
History” and “SOFC System Components Similar to Flown” columns in table 2.

Many of the low temperature components and the control software available for those components 
that would be used in a hybridized SOFC power system are readily available from existing flight 
qualified hardware. However, once integrated into a power system, it would be critical to develop 
and test the system responses and control of the system for safety of flight, including off-nominal 
flight conditions. The obvious components that have little or no flight history are the SOFC stacks 
and reformation hardware. Although limited SOFC and reformation systems have been operated 
from  a  mobile  ground  vehicle  [5]  or  on  small  micro-tubular-based  SOFC  Unmanned  Aerial 
Vehicle  [6]  demonstrators,  there  are no  data  that  would  be  directly  comparable  to  the  targeted 
flight  application.  Significant  development  and  testing  of  the  SOFC  and  reformer  would  be 
required for a flight application. 

Although some components, such as an SOFC stack and reformer, are not specified in the 14 CFR 
23  requirements,  the  hazards  associated  with  those  components  and  rules  to  ensure  safety  are 
similar  to  existing  engine  requirements.  Most  of  the  regulations  that  would  be  required  to 
implement a future SOFC system are already  in  place for  existing  technology, and  only  minor 
changes to include SOFC systems are needed. For example, most of the rules associated with an 
engine fire or high temperature failure would be directly applicable to a high temperature failure 
in an SOFC stack.  

An SOFC-based power  system, including a  battery hybridized SOFC-based power system, has 
many  similar  failure  modes  for  which  protections  are  already  captured  through  14  CFR  23 
requirements. By including an SOFC into some of the existing sections for engine requirements, 
safety design requirements for an SOFC hybrid system would be covered. This is primarily due to 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the fact that although an SOFC-based system would operate differently than an ICE, most of the 
system interfaces are similar as they are both higher operating temperature liquid fueled, external 
air flow supported systems. Some of the existing ICE engine interfaces, such as various cooling 
loops,  would  not  be  necessary  with  an  SOFC-based  system;  however,  an  SOFC-based  system 
would not have the performance and failure history of a standard engine system. Some examples 
of existing engine requirements [4] that would be directly applicable to an SOFC-based system are 
as follows: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Fuel line & fuel feed design requirements (e.g. “In each area where flammable fluids or 
vapors might escape by leakage of a fluid system, there must be means to minimize the 
probability of ignition of the fluids and vapors, and the resultant hazard if ignition does 
occur.”) 
Firewall compartment design requirements (e.g. “Each engine, auxiliary power unit, fuel 
burning  heater,  and  other  combustion  equipment,  must  be  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the 
airplane by firewalls, shrouds, or equivalent means.”) 
Flammability  and fire sensing requirements  (e.g. “There must be means that ensure the 
prompt detection of a fire in … Airplanes with engine(s) located where they are not readily 
visible from the cockpit”) 
Air duct design and  location and design (e.g. “The airplane must be designed to prevent 
water  or  slush  on  the  runway,  taxiway,  or  other  airport  operating  surfaces  from  being 
directed into the engine or auxiliary power unit air intake ducts in hazardous quantities. 
The air intake ducts must be located or protected so as to minimize the hazard of ingestion 
of foreign matter during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.”) 
Electrical system design and protection (e.g. “Electric power sources, their transmission 
cables,  and  their  associated  control  and  protective  devices,  must  be  able  to  furnish  the 
required power at the proper voltage to each load circuit essential for safe operation”) 
Battery system design and safe operation (e.g. “Safe cell temperatures and pressures must 
be maintained during any probable charging and discharging condition. No uncontrolled 
increase  in  cell  temperature  may  result  when  the  battery  is  recharged  [after  previous 
complete discharge.]) 

The vast majority of existing safety regulations for internal combustion, turboprop, turbine, and 
APU power sources are applicable to a future SOFC system. Only minor language changes, such 
as updating the terminology of “engine” to include SOFC or to use the more inclusive term of 
“power plant” or a similar equivalent, are necessary to incorporate a liquid fueled SOFC. Areas of 
regulations,  including  existing  power  loss,  structural  loads,  performance,  flammable  fluid,  fire 
protection, and other requirements, are directly applicable to an SOFC power system. The majority 
of electrical design and battery safety regulations are directly applicable to an SOFC hybrid power 
system with only minimal changes to wording. For a hybrid SOFC/battery, definitions would need 
to be updated to clarify the existing regulations in regard to using both SOFC and battery power 
in parallel, rather than the battery as only a starter and backup system. Examples of modifications 
that might be needed for 14 CFR 23 are listed in table 3. The performance limitations identified in 
the Airplane Flight Manual and Approved Manual Material would also need to be updated based 
on  the  SOFC/battery  system’s  detailed  testing  and  operational  history  specific  to  the  system 
configuration.

Example Changes for Incorporation of an SOFC-Based Power 
System into 14 CFR 23 

Terminology change to be inclusive of SOFC-based power 
systems. For example, change unique engine specific call-outs 
such as “reciprocating engine-powered airplane of more than 
6,000 pounds maximum weight, single-engine turbine, and 
multiengine turbine airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less 
maximum weight” to include alternative power systems. In all 
sections, one suggestion would be to change the word 
“engine” to “power plant” or redefine the word “engine” to 
include an SOFC-based system. 
Terminology change to include systems where engine is not 
directly physically coupled to motors. Mounting requirements 
for propellers driven by electric motors would be distinct 
from power system mounting requirements. 
Terminology would need to be updated to include 
SOFC/battery hybrid system as a “power plant” which would 
fall under most of the same regulations where applicable as 
“Engines” or auxiliary power units. For example, existing 
regulations regarding firewall, component failures not 
cascading, compressor, and installation are directly 
applicable. Definition of “starting and stopping” for an 
SOFC/battery hybrid system would have to be reconsidered 
as the SOFC system may not have a traditional rotating 
component producing power. An alternate approach would be 
to make a separate subcategory for SOFC specific 
requirements. This would be similar to how there are separate 
call-outs for engine turboprop or turbocharger specific 
requirements. 
Although it is not necessary, a separate category similar to the 
one called out for Turbocharger Systems could be made to 
consolidate existing requirements that are applicable to an 
SOFC system into one section.

response), the terminology would have to be updated to 
include the electrically driven system approach. 
The hybrid SOFC system will not have a standard ignition

shut-off. 
A hybrid SOFC system would not be able to utilize most

requirements for activating an SOFC system.

SOFC hybrid power system will generally be limited by 
temperatures, pressures and charge/power production rates. 
This section will need to be updated based on the final system 
configuration installed into the aircraft. Although the system 
studied under this effort is for pressurized operation, other 
potential SOFC-based systems may operate at near ambient 
pressures depending on the system design. The terminology 
also needs to be changed to include SOFC power systems 
where “engine” is specifically called out. 
Throughout this section, the terminology should be changed 
to include SOFC power systems where “engine” is 
specifically called out. The design and operating information 
in the manual will need to reflect any installed SOFC hybrid 
power system. 

3.2  PHYSICAL INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT FOR SOFC-BASED POWER SYSTEM 

An  integration  of  a  hybridized  SOFC-based  power  system  into  an  aircraft  is  not  a  drop  in 
replacement and would affect multiple aspects of the target application. 

The X-57 Mod 2 flight demonstrator is initially certified up to an altitude of 15,000 ft mean sea 
level (MSL), which was the focus of the FUELEAP study. Depending on the configuration, 14 
CFR 23 type aircraft may be able to fly as high as 25,000 ft MSL without significant modification. 
A hybridized SOFC-based power system could be designed to support the full 25,000 ft altitude, 
although this was outside the scope of the FUELEAP target application. Typical cruise altitudes 
for  the  FUELEAP  application  are  between  5,000  and  10,000  ft  MSL.  Flight  performance 
requirements, such as climb and glide, would be similar between a conventional propulsion system 
and an SOFC-based power system driven aircraft. 

The hybridized SOFC power system has the majority of its power produced electrochemically and 
has a more extensive electrical system than a standard ICE engine. Both higher voltage and lower 
voltage buses are incorporated with multiple power sources (i.e. SOFC, battery, generator) and 
different  load  distribution  approaches,  as  identified  in  figure  4.  A  single  hybrid  SOFC  power 
system  supplies  the  power  usually  generated  by  two  separate  engines. Power2  used  to  size  the 
FUELEAP system is shown in table 4. Because there is a single hybrid power system, the system 
must be designed with the intent of redundancy so that safe flight is achieved even if there are 
component failures within the system.

The 14 CFR 23 regulations delineate between high or low voltage bus requirements. Even though 
the hybridized  SOFC  power  system  will  operate a  higher  voltage  bus, the  design of  the higher 
voltage  system  is  bounded  by  existing  commercial  and  military  flight  electrical  design 
specifications. 

Structural  and  load  requirements  in  14  CFR  23  regulations  for  power  systems  mounted  in  the 
fuselage of an aircraft would be  applicable to the  hybridized SOFC power system. This  would 
include design factor of safety, nominal loads, vibration, crash loads, and mounting. 

3.2.1  Expected Interfaces for Hybrid SOFC Power System 

Necessary  interfaces  for  an  SOFC-based  power  system  are  expected  to  be  similar  for  both  the 
targeted demonstrator and future commercial aircraft systems. Interfaces between an SOFC-based 
power system and the environment, ground cart, or vehicle include: 

• 
• 

Access for installation, checkout, and maintenance 
Fluid interfaces: 

- 

- 
- 
-

- 

Air intake, primarily for SOFC reactant. Some smaller portion of air intake might 
be necessary for cooling flow for power and control electronics. The SOFC stack 
and fluid components are not expected to need additional cooling flow beyond what 
is fed through the stack and system. 
Fuel inlet, from fuel tank(s) 
Exhaust port(s) 
Cooling fluid, if needed

More detailed data on the failure analysis can be found in the Boeing Proprietary 
Appendix A to this report. 

4.1  SOFC POWER SYSTEM FAILURE ASSESSMENT 

A system level failure assessment was performed on the sample SOFC Power system described in 
section  3.0.  As  many  of  the  components  are  similar  to  ones  previously  used  in  aerospace 
applications, many of the failure modes are well understood. Specific failure mode possibilities 
and probabilities are highly dependent on the final configuration of the SOFC power system and 
the design of the specific components. Examples of  possible failure modes for components are 
listed in table 7.

Safety of flight for any aircraft depends on minimizing and controlling any potential catastrophic 
failures of an aircraft. A catastrophic failure is defined as one that could result in multiple fatalities 
of aircraft occupants or incapacitation or fatal injury to a flight crewmember normally with the 
loss  of  the  airplane.  Many  of  the  existing  14  CFR  23  requirements  are  put  in  place  to  restrict 
designs that would result in a catastrophic failure and to provide design guidance toward system 
redundancy and reliability based on flight operations. Based on the aircraft power system design, 
some power system component failures would be benign, whereas others, if not controlled, could 
be catastrophic. Failures with a higher criticality would be those that occur suddenly, reducing any 
pilot or system reaction time and that have the potential to cause significant damage, or propagate 

16 

 
to the point where they can cause significant damage to the aircraft. Some examples of a critical 
failure would be uncontrolled fire or a sudden loss of power. 

Failure modes newly introduced to a lightweight aircraft by an SOFC-based power system would 
be associated with components of the system with minimal flight history. As mentioned in table 
2, the components in this category would be the SOFC stacks, steam reformer, and the software 
used to control the system. A brief overview of the SOFC stack and steam reformation technology 
are discussed below. Control software would be highly variable and is considered beyond the scope 
of this assessment. 

There  are  multiple  types  of  fuel  reformation;  steam  reformation  was  studied  for  this  example 
system.  Steam  reformation  occurs  at  temperatures  ~600°C  and  uses  incoming  fuel  mixed  with 
steam to break down the higher hydrocarbons in the fuel in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction 
is  endothermic  and  requires  a  heat  source,  either  from  the  incoming  fluids  or  an  external  heat 
source, to be stable. Steam reformers are typically passive devices with large internal surface areas 
for the reaction. Valves and heaters control the flow going to the reformer, although heaters can 
also be integrated into the reformer unit itself. Figure 6 shows an example of a steam reformer 
developed by Precision Combustion, Inc. [7]. In a steam reformer, any internal leakage would be 
between the  fuel and steam flows,  which  would  not  be a combustible mixture. The  worst-case 
failure mode for a steam reformer would be that of fuel externally to ambient. This is considered 
a lower probability, as most reformer units use metal components with limited sealing surfaces in 
the design. 

Figure 6. Catalytic steam methane reformer from PCI (7.5 kWth) 

Planar designed SOFC stacks were assumed for this study, as they have the potential to provide 
lower volume for higher power out than tubular SOFC technology. Figure 7 shows example planar 
SOFC stacks made by OxEon Energy [8], as well as a close-up of flow within the stack. In planar 
SOFC stacks, individual cells are stacked up in series with interconnect plates in-between. Fuel 
flows across  one side of  the  cell and oxidant flows across the other side. The fuel and  oxidant 
streams are separated by seals on each side of each cell, as well as seals separating the fuel streams 
from surrounding environment. Planar SOFC stack designs vary greatly, but all require sealing on 
each side of each cell. Because both air and fuel are flowing in close proximity in an SOFC stack, 
it is a worst-case failure location for leakage than a steam reformer. 

17 

 
 
Figure 7. Example SOFC Planar stack & flows in a cell by OxEon Energy 

SOFC technology operates at high temperatures, between 600° to 1000°C, depending on the stack 
design. These temperatures are above the AIT of most fuels. Historically, most failures internal to 
SOFC stacks are slow to develop and occur over tens or hundreds of hours of operation. SOFC 
planar  stack  technology  is  considered  to  be  at  a  lower  technology  readiness  level  than  Proton 
Exchange  Membrane  Fuel  Cell  technology,  which  has  already  been  commercialized  in 
automobiles. 

Assessment of the SOFC power system failure modes, in conjunction with the amount of similar 
flight or non-flight data available on component failures, identified the worst-case failures to be 
those capable of causing a fire or explosion. Of the components introduced by an SOFC power 
system, the SOFC stack component was determined to have one of the higher probabilities of being 
a source of a critical failure, mainly due to the lack of development data, the amount of sealing 
surfaces, and the availability of both a fuel and oxidizer being used in the component.  

4.2  SOFC SYSTEM HIGH TEMPERATURE LEAKAGE FAILURE ASSESSMENT 

Analysis  of  SOFC  power  system  additional  worst-case  failure  modes  introduced  by  SOFC 
technology, such as high temperature leakage and material degradation of the SOFC stack, was 
performed. The purpose of the analysis was to help better understand any potential damage that 
could be introduced by a worst-case SOFC failure scenario. As discussed previously, the worst-
case SOFC system failure scenario is assessed as a leakage between the fuel and oxidant in the 
SOFC stack.  

Two primary  leakage scenarios  were identified for  SOFC failures,  based on the  temperature at 
which the leakage occurred: 

18 

 
  
 
1. 

2. 

At leakage above the fuel AITs, a worst-case leakage could result in a sustained flame of 
burning  gas  producing  a  heat  flux  that  may  heat  surrounding  structures  to  the  point  of 
failure. 
At leakage below the fuel auto-ignition temperatures, a worst-case leakage could result in 
rapid combustion producing a pressure load that may damage surrounding structures from 
overpressure. 

A liquid fueled SOFC-based power system would be using a fuel reformation process to break 
down  the  higher  hydrocarbon  chains  into  a  mixture  usable  for  an  SOFC  cell  (e.g.,  mixture  of 
hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and nitrogen). The actual percentage 
of each species would vary greatly depending on the type of reformation used (i.e. Catalytic Partial 
Oxidation, ATR, or Steam). For the analysis, a steam reformation case was used to represent a 
nominal  fuel mixture that  would  be input  to  the  SOFC,  and  a  pure  hydrogen  case was  used to 
represent an upper bound of the maximum energy that could be released in a failure. It should be 
noted that no hydrocarbon liquid fueled SOFC would be using pure hydrogen as a fuel; therefore, 
the pure hydrogen case is not a realistic scenario for this application. 

4.2.1  Sustained Flame Scenario 

SOFC  electrolyte  becomes  electrochemically  active  at  high  temperatures,  generally  between  
600–1000°C. This operating temperature is above the 536°C AIT of hydrogen and the 200–300°C 
AIT  of  other  liquid  hydrocarbon  based  fuels;  therefore,  at  SOFC  operating  temperatures,  any 
quantity of fuel and oxidant mixing from leakage immediately reacts to produce heat and water. 
The  lower  explosion  limit  and  higher  explosion  limit  of  a  fuel/oxidant  mixture  does  not  apply 
above the AIT since any fuel and oxidant immediately reacts. In this manner, at SOFC operating 
temperatures  no  buildup  of  fuel  and  oxidant  is  possible,  removing  the  hazard  of  an  explosive 
mixture forming. Instead, the worst-case failure scenario of a leakage would result in a sustained 
heat source at the leak site from the resultant continuous combustion reaction between the leaking 
fuel and oxidant. The analysis for this scenario is discussed further as a sustained flame failure 
case. 

4.2.1.1  Sustained Flame Analysis Approach 

A sustained flame failure case is when a pressurized reservoir of fuel gas mixture, as specified by 
molecular  molar  ratios  x1  at  pressure  p1  and  temperature  T1,  is  leaking  into  a  surrounding 
atmosphere with molecular molar ratios x2 at pressure p2 and temperature T2 through an orifice of 
diameter d. This scenario is shown in figure 8. In this scenario, the system is operating above the 
AIT, and combustion will instantaneously occur when the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together. 
This will result in the creation of a diffusion flame centered at the region of fuel leakage. Therefore, 
in this scenario, there will be no build-up of fuel or potential for large pressure effects. Instead, 
there will be a constant or sustained thermal impact as the fuel combusts and releases energy. This 
thermal energy will be divided among 1) heating the baseplate through which the fuel is leaking, 
). The following analysis is 
(
primarily concerned with estimating the magnitude of these heat flux terms.

, and 3) heating of the surroundings (

), 2) radiation (

19 

 
Figure 8. Important parameters in determining heat loads to surrounding structures 

The conditions considered in estimating the heat flux are: 

Fuel, x1. Two extremes were considered for the fuel that could be leaking:  

1.  Reformed fuel gas flow: A mixture of 28.5% hydrogen, 21.0% carbon monoxide, 27.6% 

water, 22.8% carbon dioxide, and 0.1% methane by volume. 

2.  Pure (100%) hydrogen representing the absolute worst potential mixture from a 

combustion safety point-of-view.  

Oxidizer, x2. The surrounding atmosphere is air; for this analysis, air was taken to be exactly 21% 
oxygen, 79% nitrogen. 

Reservoir Pressure, p1. Two cases were considered for the reservoir pressure: 

1.  45 psia (310.3 kPa), the higher pressure case. 
2.  20 psia (137.9 kPa), the lower pressure case.  

Note that the greater reservoir pressures result in greater fuel flow rates and consequently greater 
heating, and, therefore, the maximum pressure case is the limiting case.  

Surrounding Pressure, p2. The surrounding atmosphere was considered to be at 1 atm (14.7 psia 
or 101.3 kPa).  

Temperature, T. Both the initial unburned temperature and the temperature of the surroundings 
 C for both the reservoir and surroundings. Note that this temperature is above 
is 
the AIT for hydrogen, and, therefore, spontaneous combustion is expected upon mixing of the fuel 
and oxidizer.  

𝑇𝑇1 = 𝑇𝑇2 = 800

3. 

Calculate  the  properties  of  the  flame’s  burned  gas.  These  calculations  were  performed 
using the computational chemical kinetic software Cantera and the GRI-Mech 3.01 high 
temperature mechanism to provide realistic estimates of the thermodynamic properties of 
the flame. 
Determine the mass flow rate of fuel as a function of orifice size and reservoir pressure 
using  choked  or  isentropic  flow  equations  as  appropriate  for  the  ratio  of  the  reservoir 
pressure to the surrounding pressure. It should be noted that viscosity was not incorporated 
in this analysis and, therefore, the overall fuel leakage is overestimated. This produces a 
conservative estimate on the total heating that could occur. 
Estimate the regions where the available thermal energy will be deposited. The available 
locations are:

a function of orifice diameter and reservoir pressure, with the calculated thermal powers shown in 
figure 10. These calculations show that the reformed gas releases approximately 85% less total 
thermal power than a pure hydrogen mixture stored at the same initial pressure. This reduction is 
primarily caused by the reduced enthalpy of combustion of the reformed gas relative to hydrogen.

Figure 10. Total thermal power available in flame for different conditions 

The total thermal power as calculated in figure 10 is transferred by the following methods: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

Heating the material, or baseplate, through which the fuel is leaking 
Radiating energy evenly in all directions 
Heating the surrounding gas 
Heating any other structures in the immediate vicinity of the flame 

The distribution of heat among these destinations may not be calculated without knowing the full 
geometry and resulting flow field; however; rough estimates may be made based on general SOFC 
design assumptions: 

• 

• 

Baseplate: Examining the spreading angle of a turbulent flame and assuming that the region 
of interest for heating the baseplate is 1 orifice radius of fuel/air results in an estimation of 
25% of the total thermal power going into heating the baseplate.  
Radiation:  The  radiation  per  unit  length  of  flame  may  be  estimated  for  different  fuel 
mixtures and will largely be driven by soot generation. Limits of radiation for a sooty flame 
are generally estimated as approximately 25% of the total available power of the flame. 
Note  that  this  is  an  approximate  upper  bound  on  the  radiating  power  and  is  highly 
dependent on the flame properties (i.e., pure hydrogen flames will have less radiation as 
no soot is created2).  

2 Note the present discussion is an order-of-magnitude investigation applicable to generic conditions; multiple models exist capable of providing 

a more quantitative threat assessment relevant to specific conditions.

The remaining 50% (approximately) of the total thermal power is then available for locally 
heating the gas and surrounding structures. 

4.2.1.6  Sustained Flame Scenario Summary 

An  analysis  has  been  performed  examining  the  range  of  thermal  loadings  that  could  exist  if  a 
leakage of fuel into a hot air atmosphere occurred. Such a leakage of fuel would produce immediate 
spontaneous ignition of the fuel and the creation of a diffusion flame centered at the location of 
fuel leakage. The principle threat posed by a flame is the thermal load produced that may damage 
nearby structures and components. The total heat flux expected from such a flame was calculated 
for different fuel reservoir pressures (45 psia and 20 psia), fuel types (either reformate gas or pure 
hydrogen), and as a function of orifice diameter. It is noted that: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Viscosity was not included in the above analysis. Incorporating viscosity will result in less 
fuel leaking out of a given sized orifice and consequently a decrease in actual thermal load. 
The effect of viscosity will increase as the orifice size is decreased.  
Pure hydrogen yields nearly 7 times the thermal load relative to the reformate gas under 
otherwise identical conditions. This is caused by the considerably higher heat of hydrogen 
combustion  relative  to  the  hydrogen-carbon  monoxide-carbon  dioxide-water-methane 
mixture that composes the reformate gas. 
Although the actual damage incurred by the flame would ultimately be dependent on the 
location of the flame and surrounding geometry, it is noted that the approximately 360 W 
released by the reformate gas leaking through a 0.5 mm-diameter orifice is a small thermal 
load relative to typical hazardous combustion processes.  
The actual geometry in which the leak occurs will strongly affect how the heat is dissipated 
into the surroundings. The thermal power of the flame will be most efficiently transferred 
to a structure if the flame directly impinges on the structure. Therefore, it is noteworthy 
that the flame length is only a function of orifice diameter, and not a function of the pressure 
drop across the orifice. 

4.2.2  Rapid Combustion Scenario 

4.2.2.1  Rapid Combustion Scenario Summary 

Rapid  combustion  occurs  when  a  pressurized  reservoir  of  fuel  of  gas  mixture,  as  specified  by 
molecular molar ratio xfuel, leaks into a surrounding atmosphere composed of air and ignition does 
not immediately occur, resulting in a pre-mixed combustible mixture defined by the pressure p0, 
temperature T0 and fuel-air equivalence ratio ϕ. After the creation of such a mixture, an ignition 
source  would  produce  a  propagating  combustion  wave  that  consumes  the  mixed  fuel-air.  The 
combusting  gas  will  create  elevated  temperatures  that  may  damage  exposed  structures  and  an 
overpressure that may damage containment. Unlike the sustained flame scenario considered above 
in  which  it  was  assumed  that  an  unlimited  amount  of  fuel  may  exist,  in  the  case  of  rapid 
combustion,  it  is  typical  that  the  finite  amount  of  flammable  mixture  results  in  the  impulsive 
pressure  load  being  a  greater  threat  than  the  elevated  temperature.  This  section  examines  the 
factors that affect the overpressure and calculate the upper bounds of such an overpressure. 

25 

 
 
The conditions considered in estimating the pressure load are: 

Gas mixture, x. In practice, a localized leak of fuel into a volume of air would produce a range of 
fuel-air  equivalence  ratios  with  the  gas  near  the  leak  having  a  higher  fuel  concentration  than 
regions far from the leak. To examine the safety and range of such a leak’s effects, the mixed case 
was examined wherein the entire volume is at a constant worst-case equivalence ratio. 

Two fuels were considered and the range of overpressures as a function of equivalence ratio were 
examined for both:  

1.  Reformed fuel gas flow: A mixture of 28.5% hydrogen, 21.0% carbon monoxide, 27.6% 
water, 22.8% carbon dioxide, and 0.1% methane by volume. The chemical equation is:

4.2.2.2  Calculation of Constant Volume Explosion Pressure 

If ignition occurs in a chamber containing mixed fuel and oxidizer, a flame would grow from the 
point of ignition and propagate to consume the entirety of the fuel/oxidizer mixture. As the flame 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
expands and consumes the reactants, the release of energy will result in an increase of pressure in 
the chamber. Multiple factors of the system design will affect the resulting pressure, including:  

1. 

2. 

3. 

The degree of venting: A propagating combustion wave will produce a pressure that varies 
with  time.  If  the  chamber  is  not  fluid-tight,  the  pressure  in  the  chamber  will  vent  as 
combustion occurs and the resulting explosion pressure will be decreased. 
The  degree  of  cooling:  As  the  flame  propagates,  thermal  energy  will  be  lost  to  the 
surroundings. Per the ideal gas law, the cooling gas will decrease the pressure. Cooling is 
an important factor in small volumes or other volumes with a high surface area-to-volume 
ratio. 
Flame acceleration: As the combustion wave propagates, it induces a flow field in the gas. 
If this flow field becomes turbulent, the time scale governing the mixing of the unburned 
reactants with the hot products decreases, therefore, producing an acceleration of the flame. 
Sufficient  acceleration  may produce  a detonation through  the deflagration-to-detonation 
transition  (DDT)  process;  supersonic  detonations  are  characterized  by  higher  peak 
explosion pressures than subsonic flames. Even if DDT does not occur, flame acceleration 
will  result  in  an  increase  in  the  combustion  pressure  because  the  mitigating  factors  of 
venting and cooling will be attenuated. Note that a smaller volume allows for less space in 
which the combustion wave may accelerate and, therefore, decreases the amount of flame 
acceleration that may occur. 

To  understand  the  range  of  overpressures  that  could  exist  and  how  the  overpressure  would  be 
affected by the fuel type (reformate gas or hydrogen) and initial temperature, the constant volume 
(CV) explosion pressure was calculated. This theoretical pressure assumes complete combustion 
without  cooling.  It  is  the  peak  pressure  that  occurs  behind  a  detonation  wave  and  is  the  upper 
bound  for  deflagration  waves.  Although  specialized  circumstances  such  as  DDT  or  reflected 
detonation may produce short-lived pressures in excess of the CV pressure, for most cases, it is a 
conservative estimate of the pressures that may be produced by a mixed combination of fuel and 
oxidizer.  

The analysis method to determine the pressure loads was to calculate the CV explosion properties 
for the conditions specified for the rapid combustion scenario to determine the peak pressure that 
could  be  expected  in  an  arbitrary  volume.  These  calculations  were  performed  using  the 
computational  chemical  kinetic  software  Cantera  and  the  GRI  Mech  3.0  high  temperature 
mechanism. The results of these calculations are shown in figures 11 and 12.  

Figure  11 shows  the  CV  explosion  as a function  of  temperature  for  the different  conditions  of 
interest,  calculated  at  a fuel-air equivalence  ratio  of  1.  It  is  observed  that  pure  hydrogen  has  a 
higher CV pressure than reformate gas owing to the increased energy density of hydrogen. In both 
reformate and hydrogen fuel cases, the CV pressure decreases as temperature increases based on 
the  decreasing  number  of  moles  of  flammable  gas;  therefore,  at  increased  temperature  and 
decreased  density,  the  total  explosion  pressure  and  energy  released  from  the  explosion  also 
decreases.  

27 

 
Figure 11. Constant volume explosion pressure vs. initial unburned temperature (ϕ = 1.0) 

Figure 12 shows the CV pressure as a function of fuel-air equivalence ratio. It is observed that the 
CV  pressure  for  all  cases  peaks  at  an  equivalence  ratio  greater  than  1.  Although  the  peak  CV 
pressure for the reformate gas is not substantially reduced relative to pure hydrogen (the peak CV 
pressure for reformate gas is 81.9% the peak CV pressure for hydrogen), the reformate gas has a 
peak explosion pressure at equivalence ratio ϕ = 1.44, whereas pure hydrogen has a peak pressure 
at  ϕ  =  1.11.  This  difference  in  peak  explosion  equivalence  ratio  indicates  that  more  moles  of 
reformate gas must be released to achieve the peak pressure as compared to the hydrogen case. 
The total explosion pressure for the reformate gas is moderately decreased relative to hydrogen, 
but the biggest reduction in explosion pressure results from decreasing the starting pressure “p0”. 

28 

 
 
Figure 12. Constant volume explosion pressure as a function of the fuel-air ratio 

In figures 11 and 12, the starting pressure substantially increases the resulting peak CV pressure. 
This is further examined in figures 13 and 14 in which the CV pressure is normalized by the starting 
pressure. Figure 13 is calculated using a fuel-air equivalence ratio of 1, whereas figure 14 has a 
variable fuel-air equivalence ratio. These figures show that the CV pressure is essentially linear 
with  starting  pressure  for  all  cases  considered  for  a  given  fuel-air  mixture.  Both  figures  show 
results normalized by the initial unburned pressure.

4.2.2.3  Rapid Combustion Summary  

The actual combustion pressure will be time-dependent and substantially affected by the size of 
the volume  in  which  ignition  occurs, the  degree  of flame acceleration,  the presence  of venting 
during the combustion process, and the magnitude of cooling during the combustion process. In 
this section, the worst-case pressure for a generic geometry was estimated by calculating the CV 
explosion pressure. This provides a quantitative estimate for the worst-case explosion pressure for 
a  generic  geometry  and  allows  for  the  examination  of  the  quantitative  effect  of  different 
parameters. The following was observed from the analyses:  

• 

• 

• 

• 

The reformate gas has a peak explosion pressure at an equivalence ratio of ϕ = 1.44. The 
reformate explosion pressure is still 81.9% the peak pressure of pure hydrogen but requires 
more  moles  of  fuel  for  this  pressure  to  be  achieved.  (Hydrogen  has  a  peak  explosion 
pressure at an equivalence ratio ϕ = 1.11.) 
At constant initial pressure, the CV explosion pressure decreases as temperature increases. 
This is caused by the reduction in the total number of moles of flammable gas. Note that 
this affect is complicated by flame speed increasing with temperature. Therefore, a hotter 
mixture in test will produce a faster flame, and the peak pressure will be closer to the CV 
explosion pressure (i.e., although the CV pressure decreases with increasing temperature, 
multiple factors will influence the actual pressure that is measured in testing).  
At constant initial temperature, the CV explosion pressure increases as pressure increases 
and the increase in CV pressure is linear with the initial pressure. Note that DDT more 
readily occurs at high pressures and, therefore, other factors than the predicted CV pressure 
may complicate the actual pressures observed in testing. However, unlike the temperature 
effect, the effect of pressure is consistent. Increasing the initial pressure makes the mixture 
strictly more hazardous. 
Although  geometric  effects  were  not  considered  in  the  present  analysis,  note  that 
decreasing the volume of mixed flammable gas will reduce the overpressure threat in two 
ways:  Decreasing  the  size  of  the  chamber  increases  the  effect  of  cooling,  therefore, 
reducing the achieved pressure and decreasing the volume of flammable gas reduces the 
energy of the explosion. 

4.2.3  SOFC High Temperature Failure Analysis Summary 

Analysis of the failure modes specific to SOFC technology provides a conservative estimate of 
what potential impacts may be of a failure in an airborne system. This was used to develop the test 
plan for later testing. The worst-case failure identified for an SOFC stack would be to have leakage 
between the fuel and oxidant.  

In a higher temperature environment above the fuel AIT, which is the normal range that SOFC 
technology operates, any leakage between fuel and oxidizer will have a sustained flame or constant 
thermal release signature instead of an explosion hazard. The fuel used in this scenario has the 
largest  impact  in  respect  to  the  amount  of  thermal  energy  released  for  a  given  leak  path.  For 
example, a leak of a pure hydrogen fuel would release approximately six times more energy than 
a leak of a steam reformed fuel. Any increase in pressure differential driving the leak increases the 
energy released until the flow becomes choked. The thermal energy released at the sustained flame 
site could impact the surrounding material and potentially increase the leakage area. However, the 

31 

 
method, probability, and rate of a leakage growing is extremely dependent on the leakage location 
and  the  individual  stack  design.  Analysis  of  a  sustained  flame  failure,  using  conservative  
worst-case assumptions, shows that, at a minimum, half of the heat from the flame would go into 
heating the surrounding gas, with 25% of the heat going into radiation of surrounding materials 
and 25% going into the base material surrounding the leakage. This means that, at a minimum, 
half of the heat in a failure case, and, likely, much more than half the heat in a less conservative 
analysis, would most likely be convected away from the original failure location via gas (existing 
fuel and oxidant) flow in an SOFC stack. This would help minimize the growth of the original 
leakage source and points to the benefit of ensuring all portions of the stack have adequate gas 
flow. This information also provides insight into the ability of temperature sensors to identify a 
failure  using  design  case  specific  parameters  such  as  geometry,  flowrates,  gas  species,  and 
pressures.  

In a medium or lower temperature environment below the AIT, there would be the possibility of a 
hazardous fuel/oxidizer mixture to build up to create an explosion hazard. It should be noted that 
since most SOFC stacks to date operate above the fuel AIT, this would only be caused by some 
error in the system design or an additional failure in the system, such as a system heat transfer 
device failure. This is considered the less likely failure scenario of an SOFC stack. In an explosive 
mixture buildup, the pressure of the initial mixture would have the largest effect on the energy 
released in the explosion. The fuel type in the initial mixture would have the least impact. The 
temperature of the initial mixture does have an impact on the energy that can be released from an 
explosive  mixture,  mainly  by  the  temperature  effects  on  the  density  of  the  fuel;  therefore,  as 
temperature of the gases of the explosive mixture increases, the energy that would be released from 
that explosive mixture decreases for the same volume. 

In all SOFC leakage scenarios, the use of a reformed liquid fuel results in less energy released 
during a failure than when using hydrogen as a fuel; therefore, any small leakage point in the SOFC 
stack will have a slower growth rate in a liquid fueled SOFC system, resulting in more time in 
operation before a failure affects the system. 

5.  SOFC SYSTEM MITIGATION APPROACHES 

More detailed data on the failure mitigation approaches can be found in the Boeing 
Proprietary Appendix A to this report. 

An aircraft power system that is guaranteed not to fail does not exist, and the design of one is an 
impossible goal. Instead, the development focus of any aircraft power system is to minimize the 
probability  of  failure  and  mitigate  the  impacts  of  a  possible  failure  by  design.  Some  design 
approaches  for  minimization  of  system  failure  occurrences  include  use  of  robust  components, 
design  factors  of  safety,  minimizing  system  complexity,  component  or  function  redundancy 
(design for reliability), comprehensive testing, and designing for worst-case environments. Some 
design approaches for minimizing or mitigating a system failure that has already occurred include 
component  or  function  redundancy,  sensors  to  identify  a  failure  early,  active  and  passive 
components to stop the propagation of a failure, and operational changes to minimize the effect of 
a failure. 

32 

 
 
Analysis described in previous sections identified on leakage of reactant and oxidant in an SOFC 
stack as being a worst-case failure mode, which would be introduced into an aircraft by an SOFC-
based  power  system.  Protection  against  such  a  failure  can  utilize  existing  aircraft  safety 
components and approaches that have been identified for other high temperature, liquid fuel driven 
components,  such  as  the  standard  light  aircraft  engine.  These  approaches  of  flammable  leak 
detection external to the power system include: 

• 
• 
• 

Hydrocarbon detection sensor 
Carbon monoxide detection sensor  
Fire detection 

- 
- 
- 

Pneumatic single point detector 
Thermocouples 
Thermal switches 

Many  of  existing  design  protections  in  use  for  light  aircraft  engines  are  also  applicable  for  an 
SOFC-based power system. Some of these design protections would be required by existing CFR 
regulations, assuming an SOFC-based power system meets the same requirements as a standard 
aircraft internal combustion engine. Sample failure mitigation approaches are listed in table 8.

Timely identification of an incipient failure is essential to active mitigation of failure propagation. 
As discussed in section 4, one of the worst-case failures in an SOFC stack would be leakage of 

33 

 
 
fuel  and  air  resulting  in  a  localized  combustion,  which  could  then  grow.  An  analysis  was 
undertaken  to  determine  the  most  sensitive  way  of  identifying  a  leakage  failure  scenario  is  an 
SOFC  stack.  Pressure,  external  temperatures,  internal  temperatures,  individual  or  group  cell 
voltage, and stack voltage instrumentation were considered in the analysis. Sensors for pressure 
and external identification of stack temperature were immediately discounted as being sensitive to 
small developing failures. External temperature sensors are hindered from anomaly detection by 
thermal  insulation  surrounding  hot  SOFC  components  such  that  significant  energy  buildup  is 
necessary  before  a  localized  SOFC  thermal  event  could  be  detected.  Most  SOFC  stacks  are 
designed to operate nominally at similar pressures on the fuel and oxidant side. Because normal 
operation of an SOFC stack is above the AIT, leakage at the stack would result in thermal energy 
release instead of a pressure change, making pressure identification of a small emerging failure 
difficult. Analysis subsequently focused on internal temperature measurement and stack voltages 
for early failure identification. 

Analysis was then performed on a generic stack model to ascertain relationships between a leakage 
failure occurring and the identification of the failure by internal stack temperature measurements 
and  voltage  measurements.  It  should  be  understood  that  this  analysis  was  performed  for  an 
assumed  stack  size  and  operating  conditions  to  provide  a  sensitivity  comparison;  these  results 
would change based on different stack designs. 

Previous analysis for sustained flame failure scenarios distinguished that in a leakage between fuel 
and air above the AIT, the majority of the heat from the reaction is absorbed by the surrounding 
gas flow. The analysis used conservative assumptions; it is likely that in actual failure conditions, 
higher amounts of energy than were calculated would be absorbed by the surrounding gas flow. 
This illustrates the importance of adequate gas flow in SOFC stack design and also makes it more 
likely that a failure will increase the temperature of the SOFC exhaust gas. There are substantial 
complications involved in embedding thermocouples or other temperature measurement devices 
in a high temperature, sealed, planar stack on a cell-by-cell level. A more realistic approach is to 
locate a thermocouple into fuel and air exhaust stream immediately at the exit of a stack. Measuring 
the gas temperatures at the inlet and outlet of a stack would identify the temperature rise of the 
mixed exhaust of all the cells, rather than at a more localized point in the stack. Modeling of the 
temperature rise on the fuel or air side of the stack based on a percentage of flow leakage is shown 
in figure 15. In the case modeled, leakage into the fuel side of the stack flow is more sensitive than 
the  air  side  because  in  most  SOFC  stacks,  additional  air  flow  above  what  is  needed  for  the 
electrochemical reaction is used to transport waste heat away from the cells. The model assumed 
average flowrates and that the leakage suddenly occurred at the percentage leak identified (i.e. no 
slow buildup). Results show that there is a time factor on the order of multiple minutes prior to a 
stable leak showing up in the exhaust temperature, and that a significant leakage would raise the 
temperature of the outgoing stack air exhaust from 40° at a 10% leakage rate to 90°C at a 20% 
leakage  rate.  Given  that  SOFC  stack  technology  operates  at  high  temperature,  a  20%  leakage 
across a cell would result in a 9% to 15% overall temperature change. 

34 

 
Figure 15. Sensitivity of SOFC stack exhaust temperature sensors to leakage 

Modeling of voltage measurement sensitivity of a leakage in an SOFC stack was also assessed. 
Voltages  of  electrochemical  cells are affected  by  the  partial  pressure  of  the  chemical  reactants 
based on the Nernst equation, where voltage is linearly proportional to the natural log of the ratio 
of the pressure of products over the pressure of reactants. If a reactant leaks to one side of the solid 
oxide (SO) electrochemical cell, it instantly reacts as SOFC operates above the AIT. The product 
of  that  localized  instantaneous  combustion  removes  the  reactants  previously  available  for 
electrochemical reactions from that side of the cell, diluting or lessening the available reactants. 
This dilution of available reactants at the local cell level reduces the Nernst potential and voltage 
of the cell in real time. In such a way, individual SO cell voltage measurements act as individual 
reactant leak detectors in a stack. Modeling results of expected cell voltage degradation based on 
percentage of leakage is shown in figure 16. The results illustrate that the magnitude of cell voltage 
change based on percent leakage on the fuel side is more sensitive than leakage into the air side. It 
also shows that a 10% leakage of oxidant into the air side results in a 20% cell voltage change, 
with  larger  leakages  causing  a  much  sharper  voltage  drop.  It  should  be  noted  that  voltage 
monitoring for leak/failure detection would only identify leakage that is upstream or internal to the 
cell  area.  Leakage  downstream  of  the  active  cell  area  would  not  be  identified  by  this  method. 
Dependent on SOFC stack design, physical integration of individual cell voltage monitoring can 
add  a  level  of  complexity  and  additional  potential  failure  points  for  shorting.  In  cases  where 
voltages  are  not  realistically  able  to  be  monitored  at  the  cell  level,  monitoring  groups  of  cell 
voltages or the total stack voltage could be performed. Sensitivity of the voltages in identifying a 
localized failure is therefore reduced, based on analysis, depending on the voltage drop seen at the 
cell level compared to the number of cells being monitored. Analysis identified that stack level 
monitoring, in comparison to cell level monitoring, would lessen visibility of a developing failure. 
However, the testing described in section 6 showed that the stack voltage was more sensitive to 
cell failure than was expected by analysis.

Figure 16. Sensitivity of SOFC cell voltage monitoring to leakage 

Modeling of both voltage and temperature sensors in reaction to an SOFC stack internal leakage 
failure mode determined that voltage monitoring has the ability to identify a leakage growth at a 
near real-time since it can be sensed nearer to the potential leakage location. Temperature sensing 
in the SOFC stack exhaust a time lag associated with fluid flow and mixing rate from the leakage 
location to the sensor. A failure due to leakage can drive a greater magnitude of response change 
in the voltage sensing of a cell or group of cells than the magnitude response change in the exhaust 
temperature for the same leakage size. Modeling concludes that for most stack designs, voltage 
monitoring  of  SOFC  stacks  is  more  sensitive  to  identification  of  stack  internal  leakage  than 
temperature sensors. However, because voltage monitoring would only identify leakage upstream 
of the electrochemically active area, thermal sensing of the stack exhaust is still required to identify 
any leakage in the exhaust manifolds of the SOFC stack. Thermal sensing of stack exhaust is also 
useful as a redundant sensor for failure identification. 

6.  SOFC CONTROLLED STACK FAILURE TESTING 

More detailed data on the failure testing of both SOFC stacks, including additional test 
data, can be found in the Boeing Proprietary Appendix A to this report. 

Failure  testing  was  performed  on  two  planar  SOFC  stacks  to  provide  examples  of  worst-case 
SOFC power system failures to bound effects on failure propagation. The stacks were supplied by 
two  separate  suppliers  and  were  both  development-level  stacks  at  different  stages  of  design 
maturity. Stack 1 tested to failure was designed for 250 W with < 12 cells. Stack 2 was designed 
for 1 kW containing > 30 cells. Both stacks tested had known leakage with intact cells at the start 
of the test. Each stack was tested within a pressure vessel.  

36 

 
 
 
Both stack tests were conducted using a mixture of 50% hydrogen and 50% nitrogen as fuel for 
testing, and  air was used  as the oxidant. As mentioned in  previous sections, SOFC  technology 
becomes  electrochemically  active  at  high  temperatures,  generally  between  600–1000°C.  This 
operating temperature is above the 536°C AIT of hydrogen and the 200–300°C AIT of other liquid 
hydrocarbon  based  fuels.  The  mixing  of  fuel  and  oxidant  from  leakage  immediately  reacts  to 
produce heat and water; no buildup of fuel and oxidant is possible above the AIT temperature, 
which removes any explosive hazard at high temperatures.  

The objective of the controlled SOFC stack failure testing was to verify sensitivity of voltage and 
temperature as a means of detecting cell/stack failure, in comparison to the physical damage to the 
stack when subjected to an SOFC stack’s worst-case sudden failure. This creates the beginning of 
comparable data between stack failure sensor readings and physical effects of a potential failure 
propagation  in  an  SOFC-based  power  system.  An  understanding  of  how  instrumentation 
identification  of  a  critical  failure  relates  to  actual  system  effects  is  necessary  for  the  future 
development  of  a  safe  SOFC-based  power  system.  The  tests  were  conducted  above  ambient 
pressures within a pressure vessel using a 50/50 mix of H2/N2 at the anode and dry compressed 
air at the cathode.  

Based  on  historical  test  data  at  Boeing  and  across  the  fuel  cell  industry,  the  vast  majority  of  
air-based SOFC stack failures are slow propagation failures that show up in stack voltage or gas 
temperatures tens or hundreds of hours prior to critical stack failure. The intent of this test series 
was to try to simulate a more unlikely worst-case sudden failure scenario, rather than the more 
usual stack performance degradation failures typically seen in testing; therefore, two methods were 
used in an attempt to induce a sudden SOFC stack failure: 

1. 
2. 

Electrochemical overloading of the stack while on load 
Application of elevated differential pressure across the stack 

6.1  MOBILE STACK FAILURE TESTING 

A mobile testing unit was built to support SOFC stack testing. The unit was built to provide heated 
fuel and reactant gasses to the SOFC stack, while being able to control the pressure the stack was 
tested at and the incoming gas temperatures. A cooling loop was used to cool the exhaust streams. 
The fuel side exhaust could  be  connected to lines in the test cell to route the exhaust  to  a safe 
hydrogen exhaust location for the building. Remote operated solenoid and flow regulation valves 
were used to control the reactant and safety gas flow and gave the ability to shut off the fuel flow 
without depressurizing one side or other of the fuel cell. The mobile testing unit was assembled, 
leak  tested,  pressure  checked,  and  control  software  checked  in  a  laboratory  before  the  second 
SOFC stack was installed and the unit was moved to the ventilated hydrogen test area at the Boeing 
Huntington  Beach  California  facility.  Figure  17  shows  the  piping and  instrumentation  diagram 
(P&ID) of the mobile stack failure testing unit. 

37 

 
 
Figure 17. P&ID of mobile stack failure testing unit 

6.2  FIRST SOFC STACK FAILURE TESTING 

The first stack failure testing was performed on a smaller SOFC stack of <12 cells. The first SOFC 
test stack used was in the development stage of the design process.  

The first stack tested  was exposed to  a  maximum pressure  differential  of less than 3psid when 
indications  of  a  cell  failure  occurred,  as  shown  in  figure  18  with  the  “Normalized  Worst  Cell 
Voltage” line. Only one cell in the stack showed early indication of a cell failure. The total stack 
voltage showed an approximate 20-second delay between the individual cell voltage drop and the 
total stack voltage drop. The stack voltage showed a total voltage drop greater than what would be 
expected from the loss of the failed cell voltage drop only. This indicates that once significant cell 
failure occurs in an SOFC, reactant dilution and thermal impacts from the failed cell can influence 
the performance of other cells, making the failure more visible at the total stack voltage level. In 
this test, the stack exhaust temperature did not rise until the test shutdown protocol was performed, 
which caused additional flow perturbations more than one minute after cell failure. It is believed 
that if the flows to the test stand were not modified during the test shutdown procedure, the heat 
increase  from  the  SOFC  cell  failure  would  have  shown  up  even  later  and  more  slowly.  The 
expected gas exhaust temperature increase during a cell failure is caused by combustion of H2 and 
air from cracked cell or seal leak. The thermal increase was only seen after one minute due to flow 
perturbations caused from the test shutdown. Figure 18 shows that the > 50% magnitude of the 
cell failure effects on the stack voltage was much greater than the ~10% magnitude of temperature 
change seen in the stack exhaust streams. 

38 

 
 
Figure 18. First SOFC stack controlled failure testing 

Teardown of the first stack test verified that the cell showing the worst-case cell voltage during 
testing failed  from  a  crack  in  the  cell. There  were  indications  of  some  overheating  in  the  area 
around the cell failure; however, there was no significant thermal damage outside of the cell stack 
active area. Specifically, there were no overheating effects seen internally in the stack manifolds 
or gas flow paths to and from the stack. This verified that the shutoff of fuel flow successfully 
limited  failure  propagation  by  reducing  the  total  energy  available  for  combustion  of  reactants, 
keeping the total energy  released from the stack failure  within levels  that  would  not cause any 
significant damage or material breakdown in components outside of the stack. 

6.3  SECOND SOFC STACK FAILURE TESTING 

The second stack failure testing was performed on a larger SOFC stack of >30 cells. Although this 
second SOFC test stack was also in the design development stage, it was a more mature design 
tested than the first stack. Because of the more mature design of the stack, it was able to withstand 
additional adverse conditions in operation prior to the stack failing. 

The  second  stack  was  tested  with  similar  reactant  mixtures  as  used  in  the  first  stack  testing 
(50%H2/50%N2  fuel,  air).  This  stack  was  installed  and  tested  in  the  mobile  stack  failure  unit 
described in section 5.1, and testing was conducted in an external test bay designed for hydrogen 
use.  The  second  stack  was  exposed  to  a  pressure  differential  while  stack voltages  and  exhaust 
temperatures were monitored. The second stack was subjected to electrical loading of cells to drive 
the stack voltage below normal operation limits and various pressure differential levels on both 
the anode and cathode sides of the stack. Individual cell voltages were not available for this stack 
testing, but the total stack voltage was monitored along with exhaust temperatures. 

39 

 
 
In the second stack test, differential pressure was initially applied more slowly than the first stack 
test. The second stack was able to withstand while operating a differential pressure of 15psid across 
the  stack  with  either  the  fuel  side  or  air  side  high.  During  the  phase  of  testing  where  the 
fuel/hydrogen side of the stack was pressurized, a failure due to sparking was observed in a wire 
connection  that  was  routed  from  the  test  pressure  vessel  to  the ambient  atmosphere.  This  high 
temperature, sheathed, wire was used as instrumentation during previous development testing, but 
was unused/disconnected during the second stack failure testing. Sparks and a small flame were 
observed coming  from the end of the  metal  sheathed  wire (figure 19). On identification of the 
failure, the main hydrogen fuel flow  was shut off and a nitrogen-based safety gas continued to 
flow to maintain the stack pressure. The removal of the hydrogen flow extinguished the flame at 
the end of the unused wire. The stack was unaffected by the wiring failure. Post-test inspection 
identified that there were multiple factors that contributed to the wire failure probable cause. The 
wire  dead-end  termination  likely  caused  a  reduced  insulation  gap  that  reacted  with  a  small 
hydrogen leak due to the unrealistic operating regime of the unit. The test unit was subjected to 
operating  conditions  outside  of  those  that  would  be  allowed  in  an  actual  flight  system  for  the 
purpose of inducing a sudden failure in the SOFC stack.  

Figure 19. Sparking observed during second SOFC stack controlled failure test 

Testing resumed after the wire failure, but increased pressurization was thereafter limited to the 
air side of the stack so as not to repeat the suspected cause of the wire failure of hydrogen leakage 
to  ambient.  The  second  stack  tested  was  able  to  withstand  pressure  differentials  ramped  up  to 
15psid across the stack. The stack had known internal leakage at the start of the test. Although the 
increase of differential pressure had to result in additional heat generated internal to the stack from 
the leakage, changes in the exhaust temperature over the relatively short testing time were minimal. 
To mimic a sudden failure, which would be the worst-case scenario seen in a flight application, 
the second stack tested was then subjected to sudden pressure changes on one side of the stack. A 
sudden pressure change of >15psid was applied to one side of the stack and a failure was induced. 
The failure was evident on both the stack voltage and the stack exhaust temperatures at the same 
time (figure 20). The magnitude of the change in stack voltage, an approximate 90% change in 
voltage, was  much greater  than the exhaust  temperature change,  an approximate 6%  change in 
temperature, the stack voltage was clearly a more sensitive indicator of stack failure than the stack 
exhaust  temperatures.  On  identification  of  the  failure,  the  electrical  loading  of  the  stack  was 
stopped,  the  main  hydrogen fuel flow  was  again  shut  off,  and  a  nitrogen-based safety  gas  was 
flowed on the fuel side. These actions resulted in an immediate stack voltage recovery and a soon 
after decrease in exhaust temperature, showing that the stack failure was contained.  

40 

 
 
Figure 20. Second SOFC stack controlled failure test 

After cool down of the second SOFC stack testing unit, the system was disassembled, and the stack 
was removed from the pressure vessel and inspected. The second SOFC stack tested also showed 
no significant thermal damage outside of the cell stack active area. In both the wiring failure and 
sudden stack failures seen during the controlled testing, the shutoff of the fuel flow to the stack 
quickly  stopped  the  overheating  events  and  prevented  any  propagation  of  the  failure  to  other 
components.  

7.  CONCLUSIONS 

The FAA project “Evaluation of a Lightweight Fuel Cell Containment System for Aircraft Safety” 
evaluated the potential impacts for an example future solid oxide fuel cell- (SOFC) based power 
system to be integrated into a small aircraft, as described in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) part 23. A target SOFC system using a liquid desulfurized fuel, onboard reformation, and a 
hybrid battery was assessed for impacts to existing aircraft safety regulations, new failure modes, 
similarity  to  existing  systems,  and  potential  approaches  for  safe  integration  of  the  aircraft. 
Analyses  of  worst-case  failure  modes  for  SOFC  technology  were  performed  to  bound  the 
expectations of the failure effects and also the timing for failure identification. A mobile SOFC 
stack testing unit was built and controlled failure testing was performed on two development stacks 
made by different suppliers.  

Assessment of the liquid fueled SOFC  power system in comparison  to traditional  light aircraft 
internal combustion  engine  propulsion systems  shows  that many  of  the components  used in an 
SOFC-based system are similar to those flown on other aircraft. The components unique to the 
SOFC power system are related to potential reformation and the electrochemical stack functions, 

41 

 
 
but the protections for potential failures of these solid, non-moving components are comparable to 
other high temperature components already certified for flight. The majority of existing 14 CFR 
23  regulations  could  be  directly  applicable  to  the  integration  of  an  SOFC  system  with  minor 
language modification to make existing requirements more inclusive to SOFC technology.  

Failure analysis focused on failures occurring in the planar SOFC stack, a component that would 
be new to aircraft flight testing and use. The worst-case failure for an SOFC stack was determined 
to  be  fuel  and  air  mixing  through  leakage  in  an  SOFC  stack  causing  a  sudden  stack  failure. 
Analyses of both high temperature leakage and low temperature leakage effects were performed. 
The high temperature leakage failure is considered more probable, as SOFC nominally operates 
above  the  auto-ignition  temperature  of  fuels.  Combustion  calculations  of  the  failure  scenarios 
highlighted that the release of energy from an SOFC stack leakage would be less when operating 
on a reformed liquid fuel than a pure hydrogen fuel. Combustion analysis also identified that the 
majority of the energy that would be released in a high temperature leakage would be transferred 
into the surrounding gas stream. 

Mitigation of any failures for a future SOFC-based power system must be approached using two 
methods:  1)  integration  of  redundancy  and  safety  of  flight  concerns  must  be  part  of  the  initial 
system configuration and design, and 2) existing active and passive safety components, such as 
firewalls,  instrumentation,  and  fuel  shut-off  valves,  can  be  used  to  identify  and  limit  the 
propagation  of  any  failure  that  does  occur.  Analysis  of  failure  detection  showed  that  the  most 
sensitive method of detecting a failure would be via monitoring the SOFC stack voltage. Because 
of the need for fuel to continuously be provided to an SOFC stack, a failure in the SOFC stack can 
be contained by stopping the fuel supply to the stack.  

Controlled failure testing  was  performed  on  two different planar  SOFC stacks  as a  part  of this 
project. Failure was induced by applying a pressure differential between the fuel and oxidant sides 
of  the  SOFC  stacks.  The  tests  were  able  to  validate  the  sensitivity  of  stack  voltage  versus 
temperature monitoring when a sudden failure was induced. In both tests, the fuel flow was shut-
off  once  the  stack  voltages  became  severely  diminished,  and  this  action  stopped  the  thermal 
propagation  of  the  induced  failure.  Teardown  of  both  test  articles  verified  that  no  damage 
propagated to outside of the stack in either test, and that no damage from the failure was seen in 
the surrounding components. This demonstrated that shutting off the fuel flow to the SOFC stack 
based  on  stack  voltage  monitoring  was  effective  in  limiting  any  thermal  damage  to  within  the 
SOFC stack component itself. Testing also showed that the integration of any sensors or wiring 
into the SOFC system needs to protect against the introduction of potential hazardous gas leakage 
sites.  

The analysis and testing of two different stack SOFC corroborates that for a sudden SOFC stack 
failure in an SOFC power system, shutting off of the fuel flow to the stack using existing sensor 
technology would prevent a sudden stack failure from propagating into a critical system failure.  

This project provided both analysis and test data to show that safely integrating a liquid fuel SOFC-
based  power  system  into  a  light  aircraft  is  feasible.  Although  additional  failure  modes  are 
introduced with new SOFC technology, containment and mitigation of the new failure modes are 
similar to existing aircraft safety approaches. SOFC-based power system technology still requires 
significant  development,  system  design  for  reliability,  and  comprehensive  testing  of  systems 

42 

 
designed for flight to be considered for integration in a 14 CFR 23 aircraft. Assuming that SOFC 
power system technology advances to a more mature stage, this project concludes that the safe 
integration  of  that  SOFC  technology  into  a  light  aircraft,  or  other  future  aircraft,  would  be 
achievable using safety components and methods comparable to those presently used.
