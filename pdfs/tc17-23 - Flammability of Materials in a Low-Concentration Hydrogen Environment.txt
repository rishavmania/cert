A series of tests was conducted to determine the effect that concentrations of hydrogen below its lower flammability limit can have 
on  the  burning  of other  materials.  The vertical  Bunsen  burner  test  cabinet  was  set  up  to  run  tests  with  hydrogen  concentrations 
varying between 0% and 4% by volume. Three different materials were tested: a 1/16″ thick woven carbon fiber, a fabric aircraft 
seat cover, and an 8-ply unidirectional carbon fiber. All three materials showed significantly increased after-flame times and burn 
lengths as the concentration of hydrogen increased. The burn rate of both carbon-fiber materials also significantly increased with 
increased hydrogen concentrations, whereas the burn rate of the seat-cover fabric remained relatively constant for all concentrations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Industry  is  currently  researching  the  use  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells  for  electrical  power  onboard 
aircraft. It is known that hydrogen is very explosive in concentrations above its lower flammability 
limit (LFL) (approximately 4.7% by volume in air), but what has not been researched is whether 
concentrations below this limit can increase the burning rate of   aircraft materials.  In order to 
determine this, testing was conducted using the FAA vertical Bunsen burner test method with the 
test cabinet filled with varying concentrations of hydrogen below its LFL. 

The vertical Bunsen burner test cabinet was set up in the Components Fire Test Lab at the FAA 
William  J.  Hughes  Technical  Center,  and  operated remotely  for  safety reasons.    The  hydrogen 
concentration inside the test cabinet varied from 0% to 4% by volume in increments of 1%, while 
conducting the standard 12-second vertical Bunsen burner test. 

Three different materials were tested: a 1/16-inch thick woven carbon fiber, an aircraft fabric seat-
cover material, and an 8-ply unidirectional carbon fiber.  For all three materials, the after-flame 
time  and  burn  length  significantly  increased  as  the  hydrogen  concentration  increased.  Even 
concentrations as low as 1% hydrogen had a large effect on the test results.  The burn rate was also 
calculated from the burn length divided by the after-flame time plus the 12-second Bunsen burner 
time.  The burn rate significantly increased with increased hydrogen concentrations for both types 
of carbon fiber and stayed relatively constant for the fabric seat cover.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

1.1  BACKGROUND 

Industry  is  currently  researching  the  use  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells  for  electrical  power  onboard 
aircraft.  The FAA has formed an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) to identify 
potential hazards, mitigation means, and regulatory gaps with the use of hydrogen onboard aircraft.  
One item identified by this committee was the potential impact on material flammability in the 
event  a  small  hydrogen  leak  occurs  that  results  in  a  low-concentration  hydrogen  environment.   
Hydrogen leaks can occur due to holes, breaks, or defects in material surfaces, but can also occur 
through diffusion or permeation, through the surface of the confinement vessel [1].  A previous 
FAA study showed the lower flammability limit (LFL) of hydrogen in air to be 4.7% by volume 
[2]. Similar studies by other organizations produced similar results.  However, very little is known 
about the effect hydrogen can have on burning materials when its concentration is below the LFL. 

1.2  OBJECTIVE 

The goal of this experiment was to determine the effect low concentrations of hydrogen in air can 
have on the burning of aircraft  materials. 

2.  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

2.1  TEST METHOD 

All of the testing in this experiment was based on the Vertical Bunsen Burner test for Cabin and 
Cargo  Compartment  Materials  detailed in  the FAA  Aircraft  Materials Fire  Test  Handbook  [3].  
The exact test procedure was followed while varying the amount of hydrogen in the test cabinet 
from 0% to 4%.  All testing was completed in the Components Fire Test Laboratory located at the 
FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center. 

The handbook states that a Bunsen burner with a 3/8-inch inside diameter barrel with methane at 
2.5 psig should be used as the fuel source, and there should be no premixing of the fuel with air. 
This produces a pure diffusion flame.  The only adjustment that can be made to the burner is the 
flow rate of the methane gas with a needle valve.  The flow rate of the fuel needs to be adjusted so 
the height of the flame is 1.5 inches.  The flame height was set with no hydrogen in the surrounding 
air, and the methane fuel flow rate to the burner was kept constant for all tests.  The burner flame 
appeared  to  be  slightly  taller  (¼  inch  or  less)  when  the  chamber  contained  hydrogen,  so  any 
increased intensity of the flame during the 12-second ignition period can be directly attributed to 
the presence of hydrogen in the surrounding air. 

For the 12-second vertical Bunsen burner test, the burner is lit prior to testing and then moved into 
position ¾ of an inch below the material sample for 12 seconds before being removed. The data 
that are to be collected from this test are the flame time, drip flame time, and burn length.  The 
flame time is the amount of time the test sample continues to burn after the burner is removed from 
beneath the specimen.  The drip flame time is the time that any flaming material continues to burn 
after falling from the specimen to the floor of the chamber.  The burn length is the distance from 
the original edge of the sample to the furthest point of flame damage on the specimen.  The material 
sample to be tested must be at least 3- by 12-inches. 

1 

 
Three samples of each material must be tested.  The test is considered a failure if the average flame 
time for all the specimens exceeds 15 seconds, the average drip flame time exceeds 5 seconds, or 
the average burn length exceeds 8inches. 

For this experiment, the Bunsen burner cabinet was operated remotely from a control room as a 
safety precaution against a possible hydrogen explosion. The cabinet is 25 ft3 in volume and was 
equipped  with  two  pressure-relief  blow-out  panels  that  would  relieve  pressure  in  the  event  the 
hydrogen in the chamber was ignited above its LFL (figure 1).  Figure 1 also shows the electric 
actuator, which moves the burner in and out of position under the test sample, and the hydrogen 
analyzer, which reads the hydrogen concentration inside the test cabinet. 

Figure 1. Automated vertical Bunsen burner cabinet that can be filled with varying 
amounts of hydrogen 

The  inside  of  the  chamber  was  equipped  with  the  moveable  Bunsen  burner,  the  electric  spark 
igniters,  the  test  sample  and  holder,  two  30  ft3/min  (CFM)  mixing  fans  to  keep  the  hydrogen 

2 

 
 
mixture  homogeneous  throughout  the  chamber,  and  intake  and  exhaust  lines  for  the  hydrogen 
analyzer (figure 2).  The hydrogen analyzer used in the testing was model H2Scan HY-Optima 
2799, with an accuracy of ±0.15% absolute for hydrogen concentrations of 0.1% to 10%.  The 
hydrogen added into the chamber and the methane fuel for the burner were each controlled by an 
electronic solenoid valve.

this experiment remotely 

2.2  TEST PROCEDURE 

For this experiment, tests were conducted on three different materials: a 1/16-inch thick woven 
carbon fiber, a fabric aircraft seat-cover material, and an 8-ply unidirectional carbon fiber.  The 
hydrogen concentration in the chamber was varied from 0% to 4% in increments of 1%.  Three 
samples  of  the  woven  carbon  fiber  and  seat  cover  material  were  tested  at  each  concentration, 
yielding 15 tests each.  There was less of the unidirectional carbon-fiber material available, so only 
two were tested at 0% and 4% and one at every other concentration. 

All the tests were operated remotely from a control room, even when no hydrogen was added. To 
begin a test, the burner was positioned underneath the spark igniter.  For the tests with no hydrogen, 
the methane fuel solenoid was opened and the spark igniter was turned on simultaneously.  When 
the flame was lit, the igniter was turned off and the actuator was used to move the burner into 
position underneath the sample.  The burner was left under the sample for 12 seconds and the fuel 
was then shut off.  A stopwatch was used to determine the after-flame time, and the exhaust fan 
was turned on to remove the smoke from the cabinet before the burn length was measured. 

3 

 
 
For tests with hydrogen, the mixing fans were  turned on  and  the hydrogen solenoid valve was 
opened until the desired concentration was reached, as indicated by the hydrogen analyzer. The 
flow of hydrogen and the mixing fans were turned off before igniting the burner and moving it 
into  position  under  the  sample  for  a  test.    The  hydrogen  analyzer  was  running  throughout  the 
duration of the test.  The test cabinet was not airtight, and some hydrogen was consumed by the 
flames  from  the  burner  and  burning  samples  during  testing,  so  the  hydrogen  concentration 
decreased from its initial setting as each individual test progressed. 

3.  TEST RESULTS 

3.1  1/16 INCH WOVEN CARBON FIBER 

The  first  material  tested  was  the  1/16-inch  -thick  woven  carbon  fiber.    When  tested  without 
hydrogen in the surrounding environment, three samples produced an average after-flame time of 
40 seconds and an average burn length of 0.63 inches.  This is considered a failure in the 12-second 
vertical Bunsen burner test, but the sample self-extinguished with a very short burn length so it 
could still provide a good basis for comparison. 

Adding  hydrogen  to  the  surrounding  environment  increased  the  flame  time  and  burn  length 
dramatically.  Even a low average hydrogen concentration of 1.08% for the next three samples 
tested increased the average flame time to 168 seconds and the average burn length to 5.87 inches.  
The flame times and burn lengths continued to increase as the hydrogen concentration increased 
until the entire length of the sample was burned at 3% hydrogen concentration.  The flame time 
then  decreased  at  4%  hydrogen  concentration,  while  still  burning  the  full  length  of  the  sample 
because the flame consumed the material faster.  Figure 3 shows the flame time and burn length 
for each sample tested.

Three examples of the woven carbon-fiber, after being tested, are shown in figure 4. Moving from 
left to right, these samples were tested at hydrogen concentrations of 0%, 1%, and 4%. The 0% 
sample had a 0.6″ burn length; 1% had a 5.5″ burn length; and 4% had an 11.7″ burn length. The 
sample holder likely caused the flame to extinguish before reaching the full 12″ in the case of 4% 
hydrogen.

The rate at which each sample burned is not a normal calculation that is done in the vertical Bunsen 
burner test, but it proved to be useful in this experiment.  It was calculated by dividing the burn 
length by the 12-second time the burner was under the sample, plus the after-flame time. The burn 
rate of each sample is shown in figure 5.  As the hydrogen concentration increased, the rate at 
which the flame consumed the sample also increased.

All  the  data  averaged  for  each  hydrogen  concentration  are  shown  in  table  1.    Because  the  test 
chamber  was  not  airtight,  and  some  hydrogen  was  consumed  by  the  flame  during  testing,  the 
hydrogen concentration decreased as each test progressed.  The initial hydrogen concentration is 
the  concentration  at  the  point  the  burner  was  placed  under  the  sample,  and  the  final  hydrogen 
concentration occurred when the test sample self-extinguished.  Also shown are the average flame 
time, burn length, and burn rate.

3.2  FABRIC SEAT COVER 

The next material tested was an aircraft fabric seat cover.  This material was less consistent than 
the carbon fiber, but still showed the same basic trends of increasing flame time and burn length 
as the hydrogen concentration increased.  Each sample was cut from the same piece of fabric, so 
it was unlikely that the inconsistency was caused by the material itself.  It was most likely because 
it  was  difficult  for  the  sample  holder  to  hold  each  sample  perfectly  straight  across  the  2-inch 
opening.  Any wrinkles or bends in the fabric could have affected the way the flame traveled up 
the sample. 

All three of the samples tested without hydrogen had a short 0.5-second flame time and less than 
3 inches of burn length.  This was well under the criteria for a material to pass this test.  When 
hydrogen was added, the flame times and burn lengths again increased dramatically.  At 1% and 
2% hydrogen concentrations, two of the three tested samples burned the full 12 inches in length. 
At3%, one of three burned the full length, and at 4%, all three samples burned the full length.  Of 
the samples that did not get fully consumed, there was still an increase in the flame times and burn 
lengths as the hydrogen concentration increased.  Figure 6 shows the results of all 15 tests.

Three examples of the seat-cover fabric post-test are shown in figure 7.  From left to right in the 
picture, they were tested at hydrogen concentrations of 0%, 2%, and 4%.  Their burn lengths were 
2.8″, 4.0″, and 12″, respectively.

Figure 7. Post-test fabric seat cover from left to right: 0% H2, 2% H2, and 4% H2 

The  burn  rate  of  the  seat-cover  fabric  stayed  relatively  constant  as  the  hydrogen  concentration 
increased,  which  was  different  than  the  carbon-fiber  material  tested.    The  hydrogen  seemed  to 
affect only the amount of material consumed in the fire, but not how fast it burned. The burn rates 
for all 15 samples are shown in figure 8.  Table 2 shows the average hydrogen concentrations at 
the beginning and end of each test and the average test results.

3.3  8-PLY TC250 UNIDIRECTIONAL CARBON FIBER 

The final material tested was an 8-ply TC250 unidirectional carbon fiber.  There was little of this 
available,  so  only  seven  samples  were  tested.    The  test  results  still  showed  the  same  trend  of

increase  from  testing  with  no  hydrogen  compared  to  1%,  and  then  a  smaller  increase  in  burn 
lengths at higher concentrations.  The results from each test are shown in figure 9.

Three of the samples tested are shown in figure 10.  From left to right, the figure shows that they 
were tested at hydrogen concentrations of 0%, 2%, and 4%.  Their burn lengths were 0.3″, 3.7″, 
and 4.7″, respectively.  The flame damage on the upper sections of all three of these samples was 
from an unrelated test and had no effect on these test results.

The burn rate of this material showed a very similar trend to the woven carbon fiber.  The burn 
rate increased as the hydrogen concentration increased, with the biggest jump coming between 0% 
and 1% hydrogen.  The results are shown in figure 11.  The average initial and final hydrogen 
concentrations, along with the average test results, are shown in table 3.

4.  CONCLUSION 

Several tests were conducted to determine whether concentrations of hydrogen below the lower 
flammability limit could affect the burning of materials.  The 12-second vertical Bunsen burner 

14 

 
 
 
 
procedure was used with a hydrogen concentration in the test cabinet that varied between 0% and 
4%. Three different materials were tested: a 1/16-inch-thick woven carbon fiber, an aircraft seat-
cover fabric, and an 8-ply unidirectional carbon fiber.  All of the test materials showed increased 
after-flame times and burn lengths with increased hydrogen concentrations.  The burn rate for both 
carbon-fiber materials also increased as the hydrogen concentration increased.  The burn rate for 
the seat-cover fabric stayed relatively constant.
